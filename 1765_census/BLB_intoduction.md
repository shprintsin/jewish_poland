**List of Jews and Karaites in the Halych Land and the Trembowla and Kolomyia Districts in the year 1765.**

Published by
**Dr. *Majer Balaban***.

This work represents the third, or more precisely, the fourth work concerning the statistics and conscription of Jews in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1765.

The first list of Jews, covering the Lviv land and the Zhydachiv district, was published by Director *Ferdinand Bostel* in 1891 (*Archive of the Historical Commission in Krakow*, vol. VI).

In volume VIII of the same publication (1888, pp. 408-427), *Dr. Alexander Czuczyński* published the "***List of Jews in the Krakow Voivodeship***".

Simultaneously, in the same volume (pp. 389-408), *Messrs. Józef Kleczyński and Franciszek Kluczycki*, published "***Number of Jewish Heads in the Crown from the 1765 Tariff***".

Thus, we have a **summary list of the Jewish population in the Crown** and **detailed lists for the Krakow Voivodeship and one land of the Ruthenian Voivodeship**.

In the summary list, the population is presented as a **lump sum for each kahal** with its attached kahals and villages belonging to the "parish" of that kahal. In both detailed lists, the population is provided separately for the **kahal** and for each **attached kahal and each village**. This detailed list specifically covers the **Halych land** along with the two districts belonging to it. The list for the *Przemyśl* and *Sanok* lands is still missing to have the complete Ruthenian Voivodeship.

We will not reiterate the wording of the constitution of May 7, 1764, concerning the census of Jews throughout the Commonwealth here. However, it is a fact that this and another regulation were implemented, namely: the dissolution of Jewish sejms and sejmiks¹). The new method of conscription is a direct consequence of this regulation.

Fiscal reasons were the cause of the dissolution of autonomous institutions existing in Poland since the beginning of the 16th century. These institutions were the sole and almost the highest and exclusive administrative, fiscal, and religious authority concerning the Jews, and in relation to the government, they served as an intermediary between the thousands of Jews and the fiscal authority of the Commonwealth. Jews almost always paid the poll tax in a lump sum, and the entire sum was guaranteed since 1580 by the sejm of the Jews of the Commonwealth, and since 1623 by two sejms: Polish and Lithuanian.

The Polish sejms, or the so-called "**assemblies of four lands**", met twice a year in *Lublin* or *Jarosław* (at the Candlemas and Pentecost). They included delegates from the sejmiks of:
*   Greater Poland (with *Masovia* and *Prussia*)
*   Lesser Poland (*Krakow* Voivodeship, part of *Sandomierz*, and several Ruthenian and *Sieradz* towns)
*   Rus (west of *Lisko*)
*   *Volhynia*
*   *Podolia*
*   The *Zamoyski Ordinance*
*   The *Bełz-Chełm Land*

Furthermore, delegates from the main voivodeship towns not incorporated according to Jewish administration into any "Land" were also present. These were: *Lublin, Kalisz, Chełm*, and since 1672, *Tykocin* with *Podlasie* and border Lithuanian towns (*Gródek*, etc.).

The land sejmiks are not entirely known to us. We have detailed data on the **Ruthenian sejmik** meeting in *Berezhany, Bóbrka, Svirzh, Kulykiv*, etc. This sejmik was attended by larger parishes (let's call them dioceses) such as: *Zhovkva, Lviv, Przemyśl, Buchach, Brody*, etc.

The **Lesser Poland sejmiks** met in *Chmielnik, Stupnica, Dąbrowa*, and included, in addition to *Krakow* (*Kazimierz*), 6 parishes: *Opatów, Pińczów, Szydłów, Chęciny, Wodzisław*, and *Olkusz*.

The **Greater Poland sejmiks** met in *Śrem, Krotoszyn*, etc., and two kahals competed here: *Poznań* and *Leszno*.

The **Volhynian sejmiks** were also attended by 6 parishes: *Ostroh, Kremenets, Kovel, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Lutsk*, and *Dubno*.

**Lithuanian sejms** met in *Brest, Pruzhany, Sialets, Khomsk*, etc., and were attended by 5 parishes: *Brest-Litovsk, Grodno, Pinsk, Vilnius*, and *Slutsk*.

On issues concerning Jews throughout the Commonwealth, both sejms sent delegations that met in *Łęczyca* or elsewhere.

This is not the place for a closer discussion of the scope of activities of the sejms; it should only be mentioned that **one of the tasks of the sejm was the distribution of taxes among the lands and cities with larger parishes**. It is clear that the sejm absolutely had to collect a larger sum than it paid to the treasury (since 1717: 220,000 PLN); it spent large sums on the amortization of debts incurred for the benefit of all Jews of the Commonwealth, or individual lands, for charitable, educational purposes, etc. In addition, deputies received per diems, and there was no lack of malversation and private interests.

The sejmiks that were to distribute the sum to the "Land", divided into individual "districts", also collected a higher sum, having their local needs. It is enough to mention that the Lesser Poland sejmik in 1754 paid out **15,513 PLN** in interest alone on "spiritual" debts and some obligations to churches and monasteries. Furthermore, the *Zhovkva* district kahal itself had a budget exceeding **20,000 PLN** in 1750, of which only about **3,000 PLN** was "poll tax"²).

This is what the words of the above-mentioned constitution of May 7, 1764, refer to:

> "As we are sufficiently aware that beyond the tax in vim of the Jewish poll tax of the sum of 220,000 PLN generally established by the constitution of 1717, older Jews, according to their private dispositions and distributions, are accustomed to collecting much larger sums with no small oppression of the entire Jewry, especially those living in royal and noble towns, and to turn them to their own use and private expenses," etc.

The Government thus wanted a larger tax from the Jews and imposed **2 PLN per head**; children under one year old were exempt from payment.

Already in 1764, the treasurer of the Jewish sejm paid the designated lump sum to the under-treasurer, and the new order came into effect in 1765. **The sejms and sejmiks were dissolved once and for all**¹), and commissioners specially appointed for this purpose, with the help of revisors (nobles), rabbis, and kahal members, were to carry out the conscription.

The commissioners for the *Halych* land and the districts connected with it were appointed: *Józef Poradowski*, *Halych* border chamberlain, and *Maciej Karwosiecki*, *Płock* master of the hunt. They compiled the "**tariff**", which we are hereby publishing. This is a well-preserved folio book, written in one hand, and at the end, signed and sealed (with wax) by both commissioners. This book is filed in the *Halych* district records: fasciculus copiarum No. 286, document number 113, and contains only a **numerical list of "Jewish heads"** with a breakdown of children under one year old – it does not contain, like the books of the *Lviv* land or the *Krakow* Voivodeship, a nominal list and division by sex and occupation.

The division is by **districts and kahals**. This is what remained of the Jewish organization: kahals with attached kahals and parish villages. This division is purely Jewish and does not coincide with the administrative division of the Commonwealth or the ecclesiastical division.

There are several towns in this land that have, in addition to parish villages, also attached kahals:
*   *Barysh* belongs to the *Buchach* kahal
*   *Pidkamin* and *Stratyn* to *Rohatyn*
*   *Zolotnyky, Vyshnivchyk*, and *Zarvanytsia* to *Pidhaitsi*
*   *Kozliv, Kupchyntsi*, and *Bavoriv* to *Ternopil*
*   *Khorostkiv* to *Strusiv*
*   *Deliatyn* to *Nadvirna*
*   *Mykhalche* to *Obertyn*

A number of villages have several or even a dozen owners (spiritual donations), and the town of *Kosiv*, along with surrounding villages, belongs half (with 6 villages) to *Dzieduszycki*, the *Halych* subcamerarius, and the other half (with 4 villages) to the *Romanowski* family.

Each sum of "heads" had to be confirmed by oath by the appropriate **revisor**, as well as the **rabbi** with two **kahal members** (or quarterly members) and the **schoolmaster**. (We do not know the difference between a kahal member and a quarterly member). Some towns did not have rabbis; sometimes two towns shared a rabbi, and the *Buchach* rabbi apparently retained his old title of "**land rabbi**". The main kahal vouched for the truthfulness of the conscription in the attached kahals; only sometimes were the quarterly members of the attached kahal ordered to swear and sign. In *Martyniv*, where there was no kahal or rabbi at all, three leaseholders vouched for the truth.

For studies on the history of Jews, the names of rabbis are sought, so we list them here by towns and districts, omitting those towns where there was no rabbi either permanently or temporarily. Naturally, instead of surnames, there are patronymics.

In the entire land, there was only one Karaite kahal, in *Halych*. At that time, it numbered **99 souls** (94 adults and 5 children under one year old). We cannot learn much about its organization from this tariff, as the "sum" was signed, as in the Jewish kahals, by two quarterly members (*Zachariasz Jakubowicz* and *Moszko Samuelowicz*) and the schoolmaster (*Mortko Samuelowicz*). The rabbi (chacham) was probably not in the community at that time, or the revisors did not want to recognize him. The Karaite kahal in *Halych* did not have any parish villages at all, which means that the Karaites lived exclusively in the town.

The commissioners began their duties – in accordance with the constitution – on **January 2, 1765**, "in *Halych* in the monastery of the Franciscan Fathers under the title of the Holy Cross remaining in the town" ... "in the presence of the Honorable and Noble *Józef Mirosław Głoskowski*, *Halych* land regent, *Stanisław Czerwiński*, *Zakroczym* cup-bearer, *Kajetan Wręcki*, *Halych* town burgrave, *Stefan Żegota Brzyski, Ludwik Taraszkiewicz, Stefan Baszczyński, Jan Hołozub, Stefan Kostrakiewicz, Wojciech Przyłuski, Michał Uruski, Paweł Krohliński* and many others assembled for this jurisdiction, as well as the appointed general bailiff *Andrzej Miholski*, the evident apparyter of this act."

The commissioners themselves first took the prescribed oath³) and then received reports from individual kahals and revisors, taking an oath from everyone to confirm the truthfulness of the calculation. The revisors, rabbis, kahal members, and schoolmasters therefore had to appear personally in the *Halych* town hall on the appointed date or provide a valid excuse for their absence.

As an example of the strictness with which this was observed, let the fact serve as proof that when the *Ternopil* rabbi *Szloma Jakubowicz* "*infelici casu*" fell out of a sleigh near *Kozliv* and had to be left "*in cura chirurgorum*" in *Kozliv*, the revisor "noble *Paweł Jaszczy*" and the carter were ordered to confirm the truth of the fact by oath, and the entire procedure was entered into the district records⁴) and included as a copy in the "**tariff**".

The order of receiving accounts and oaths, or the so-called expedition of the commission, was as follows:
*   On **January 2**, *Halych* and, it seems, *Trembowla* and *Kolomyia* were dealt with.
*   On **January 3**, *Monasterzyska* and *Mikulince*.
*   On **January 4**, *Solotvyn*.
*   On **January 14**, *Pystyn*.
*   On **January 22**, *Yabluniv*.
*   On **January 25**, *Yezupil, Mariiampil, Sniatyn, Kuty*.
*   On **January 28**, *Tlumach, Hvizdets*.
*   On **January 29**, *Zabłotów*.
*   On **February 1**, *Bukachivtsi, Ustia, Bohorodchany*.
*   On **February 3**, *Hrymailiv, Tovste, Kosiv*.
*   On **February 4**, *Tysmenytsia, Kalush, Stanyslaviv, Kamianky Velyki, Otynia, Lysets*.
*   On **February 7**, *Buchach, Zavaliv, Kopychyntsi, Sukhoslav, Chortkiv, Skalat*.
*   On **February 8**, *Potik*.
*   On **February 11**, *Yaniv, Budzaniv, Obertyn, Horodenka, Kulachkivtsi*.
*   On **February 12**, *Martyniv, Ternopil*.
*   On **February 14**, *Rohatyn*.
*   On **February 15**, *Burshtyn, Pidhaitsi, Bolshivtsi, Nizhniv*.
*   On **February 21**, *Strusiv*.
*   On **February 24**, *Voyniliv*.

A total of **49 kahals** with attached kahals and villages were covered.

The oath that the Jews took is a standard fiscal and judicial oath, but so extensive and with so many strictures and curses that it is the most perfect type of oath we have encountered so far in our studies on the history of Poland:

> "We, the rabbi and the quarterly member, citizens of the town of ............ swear to God Almighty that in performing this revision in all places and dwellings, we have truthfully listed all Jewish persons without exception, from the oldest to the youngest head, in dwellings, parishes, and journeys, not having omitted any, being led by no consideration or hatred, having taken no gifts and having accepted no promises, nor will we accept them, and we have justly fulfilled this revisory duty imposed upon us, so help us God!⁵). And if we have unfairly listed with omissions of heads, may God drown us, who created heaven, earth, air, and herbs, and may God destroy us, who delivered eight people in the ark during the flood, may that God destroy us, who burned the five cities of Sodom and Gomorrah with hellish fire, may God drown us, who spoke with Moses in the burning bush, who wrote the law given to Moses with his own finger on stone tablets. And if we swear unjustly and have written an unjust register, may God destroy us, who crushed Pharaoh in the Red Sea and led the Jews freely to the land flowing with milk and honey. And if we have revised untruthfully, may God drown us, who fed the Jews with manna in the wilderness, may He destroy us and cast us into hell with soul and body. And if we swear unjustly, may the earth swallow us up, which swallowed Dathan and Abiram, and may the leprosy come upon us, which, having left Naaman, passed to Jesse. And if we commit perjury, may we be erased from the law which God gave to Moses through the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, may the punishment come upon us which is written in the five books for perjurers. May we turn into stone, as Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt, may the bloody disease never leave us, and may we burst open in the sight of all people. May a great disease seize us, so that we never reach Abraham's bosom, and may God eternally disgrace and condemn us, and may the devils take us to hell with soul and body."

On **February 27**, the commission concluded its activities with a manifestation in the Town Hall, presenting the recalcitrant "for punishment," and depositing one copy of the "**tariff**" next to the tariff from 1729. We searched in vain for this second tariff in the relevant fascicles and volumes of acts; perhaps another researcher will have better luck.
