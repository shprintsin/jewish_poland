# Jews of the Lviv land and the Żydaczów district
# DATA SET BY F BOSTEL

As we sufficiently know that in addition to the poll tax on Jewish heads, a sum of 220,000 Polish zlotys was generally stipulated by the constitution of 1717, the Jewish elders, through their private arrangements, were accustomed to collect much larger sums from them, especially in royal and noble towns, and to use them for their own benefit, as well as for private expenses, and the Republic can have a much greater emolument from the Jewish tax without burdening them, from a fair calculation: therefore, abolishing the aforementioned sum stipulated for the poll tax as stated above, and in imitation of the constitution of 1624, we establish a general poll tax for all Jews and Karaim, both in royal, ecclesiastical, and noble cities and villages, in such a way: that after paying the tax due from the Jews for the current year 1764 according to the past custom, for future times all Jews and Karaim of both sexes, counting from the year of birth, *nullo excepto*, shall pay two zlotys annually from each head in the manner described (Vol. leg. VII, 26). With these words begins the general confederation adopted on May 7, 1764, at the Warsaw Convocation Sejm, a long article titled "Jewish Poll Tax".

The previous method of collecting the Jewish poll tax was not based on a per capita fee, as the name might suggest, but on depositing a certain lump sum, fixed in advance, into the Crown Treasury; the distribution of this tax burden among individual Jewish communities and the collection of the sum were already part of the internal administration of the Jews themselves, it was the duty of rabbis and elders. This was the case in the second half of the 17th and 18th centuries, and from 1717 the sum to be paid by the Jews as a lump sum, regardless of the number of heads, was to amount to 220,000 Polish zlotys, although, as we read above, the sum actually paid was much larger, the surplus, however, went for private gain, into the pockets of the kahal elders and rabbis. This was naturally to the detriment of the Republic's treasury; the amount of the poll tax had remained the same for half a century, while the number of Jews could have doubled during that time.

The Warsaw Confederation of 1764, seeing this irregular state of affairs and wishing to increase this source of income, decided to introduce a completely different procedure for collecting the Jewish poll tax. The principle was established that the amount of the poll tax should be in direct proportion to the number of Jewish heads; the lump sum was abolished once and for all, and a more rational taxation according to persons was introduced. From then on, every Jewish man and woman, regardless of age and status, was to pay 2 Polish zlotys annually; only children under one year old constituted an exception in this regard, as they were exempt from the tax.

The method by which the poll tax was to be collected from then on is found most precisely defined in the constitution.

Namely, as soon as this law came into effect upon its publication, the revision of Jewish heads was to be undertaken immediately. In every city where there is a Jewish kahal, this was to be done by the rabbi with a quarterly schoolmaster, and where there was no rabbi or quarterly schoolmaster, two Jews, the best householders, chosen for this purpose by the authorities, together with the schoolmaster, were to register themselves. For assistance and control, the owner or tenant, or respectively the administration, in every city and town, was to add one trustworthy and irreproachable Catholic nobleman to them.

Commissions organized in this way, consisting of four persons (three Jews and one Catholic nobleman), were to "indivisibly and continuously" visit all Jewish dwellings in the city or town, where "under the Jewish curse" all those Jews who lived in the villages belonging to the city's kahal, i.e., forming one parish, were to appear. All Jews without any exception, without any regard to sex, status, and age, were to be listed as precisely as possible "*de nomine et cognomine*", and these inventories, confirmed by their signatures, were to be submitted on January 2, 1765, in the main city of the voivodeship, land, or district, where the commissioners appointed by the Republic were also to appear, accept the inventories, and take an oath from the revisors in the following tenor:

"We N. N. swear that in making this revision in all dwellings, in all specific Jewish and Karaim persons from the oldest to the smallest head, being in dwellings, parishes, and on journeys, omitting none, we have honestly listed according to the Sejm law, not being swayed by any consideration, or hatred, we have not taken any gifts, we have not accepted any, nor will we accept them, we have justly fulfilled this obligation of revision imposed on us."

Supervision of these revisions, compulsion to perform them if necessary,

the appointment of a nobleman for control, belonged to the owners, or their representatives. A neglecting owner or, worse, one who prevents it on their estates, *ipso facto* loses all rights.

The privileges due to the nobility shall be paid a penalty of 2,000 grzywna, and in addition, they shall sit in the tower for 2 Sundays, while the clergyman shall be handed over for punishment to his superior ecclesiastical authority, who shall be obliged to punish him within six Sundays under penalty of 1,000 grzywna.

Commissioners were appointed to collect the Jewish poll tax throughout the Crown for each voivodeship, and respectively land or district, if its excessive size required it, as, for example, in the voivodeships of Kraków, Sandomierz, Ruthenia, Mazovia, and others.

These commissioners were to gather on January 2, 1765, in the main city of the voivodeship, land, or district and in the city hall, in the presence of the assembled land gentry, first take an oath:

"I N. swear etc. etc. that I will faithfully and diligently listen to the oaths of both Catholic and Jewish revisors, receive the registers written by them, and from the received registers compile a tariff for the Jewish poll tax in the designated places, adding the Jewish parishes belonging there to each city: I will write out this tariff as diligently as possible, I will submit one of them to the local acts *per oblatam*, I will undoubtedly send the other one with the revisory registers to the hands of the treasury writer at the nearest chamber, and in doing all this I will not be swayed by any favor, or fear, gift or promise, but I will be particularly content with the salary assigned to me by the Estates of the Republic, and I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill the commissarial obligation imposed on me: So help me God and the innocent suffering of His Son."

After taking this oath, the commissioner was to begin his duties by receiving the registers from the revisors. He was to check, or correct, these registers, summarize each kahal with its parish separately, take an oath from the revisors: the nobleman and the Jews, that they had conscientiously compiled the inventories, and from these inventories compile a tariff for the Jewish and Karaim poll tax within the scope of action entrusted to him. These inventories were to be compiled accurately, neatly, and with the designation of each city, town, and village, summarized together, signed by hand, and one copy deposited in the acts, and the other, as well as the revisions received from the revisors with their signatures and signed by the commissioner, sent to the nearest chamber to the treasury writer.

The work was to be completed at the latest within eight Sundays, and the Crown Treasury was obliged to immediately after receiving the tariff pay each commissioner 1,000 Polish zlotys upon receipt as compensation for the labor incurred.

Should any of the appointed commissioners - says the general confederation - refuse to undertake this function, he shall manifest this in the city hall no later than the end of October 1764, and then send this manifestation to the Economic Commission, which will appoint someone in his place...

In case of non-fulfillment of his obligations, the commissioner summoned before the economic commission *pro negligentia* shall sit for four Sundays.

In the tower, he shall pay a penalty of 2,000 grzywna; only confirmed illness exempts him from the penalty.

The tariff, prepared by the commissioners, is to be valid for five years; according to it, the Jews are to pay the poll tax to the kahal, and the kahal to the Crown Treasury in two installments, in March and September, starting from January 1, 1765.

After five years, new surveyors are to conduct a new revision and prepare a new tariff. Should any falsehoods appear anywhere, the economic commission will delegate other commissioners for control and hold the guilty accountable.

If the Jews leave any city or die out, their remaining houses shall be used to pay this tax (Vol. leg. VII, 26-9).

It is clear that such revisions and poll tax tariffs can have enormous value for us in terms of historical statistics; they would be the most important, primary source for showing the number of Jews living in Poland in the second half of the 18th century.

The issue of calculating the population in past centuries is generally difficult due to the lack of adequate sources and therefore usually cannot be strictly carried out; as for Polish Jews in particular, their calculations are based rather on the calculus of probability than on actual figures, hence they are unstable and vary greatly among themselves.

Following Czacki, the Jewish population is estimated at about 900,000 heads (Wewn: dzieje Polski za Stan. Aug. I, 166, 230), others give a higher figure, others significantly lower. Meanwhile, the Warsaw constitution of 1764 has given us the most accurate source for this statistic, to which unfortunately no one has paid attention so far; these are the lists of the Jewish population at the time of the poll tax collection, compiled by special commissioners, and as we read above, in two copies; one was to be deposited in the city hall, the other sent to the treasury.

Another matter is whether these lists have been preserved everywhere, from all of Poland, whether they have not been partially destroyed. Only special searches in archives could answer this, and it is very probable that these lists, coming from such a recent past, have been preserved in their entirety from every land, if not in one copy, then in the other.

According to Bentkowski's inventory (Rek: Ossol. 1370), lists of the Jewish poll tax are preserved in the main Warsaw archive precisely from 1765, from the voivodeships of Kraków, Sandomierz, and Lublin, from the Lviv land, Sanok land, and also from the same lands and voivodeships from later years, up to 1787.

Among the Lviv city hall books (in the archive) is volume 959 with the inscription: *Lustratio seu Tariffa capitalis Judeorum in terra Leopoliensi et districtu Zydaczoviensi existentium*. These are lists of Jewish heads based on the constitution of 1764, presented in the city hall in the first days of 1765.

The surveyors for the Lviv land appointed by the Sejm were Roch Czechowicz and Adam Białoskórski, and for the Żydaczów district Nereusz Broniewski. The lists compiled by them were, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, signed by the commissioners and by the Jewish elders. For the Jews were divided into parishes; in the larger ones, the kahals with a rabbi at the head had their seats, while several, a dozen or several dozen villages, lying within the kahal's sphere, formed its parish. Since these inventories were compiled by parishes, their external appearance, as well as their internal arrangement, sometimes show considerable differences among themselves: some, like the Lviv and Brody ones, are written very neatly and carefully, others superficially, and sometimes even quite illegibly. The neatest appearance is the inventory of the Żydaczów district, as it is organized and beautifully transcribed in clean copy.

The main difference in the internal arrangement lies in the fact that in some parishes, children under one year old, and therefore not paying tax, were not counted, while in others they are also listed. But also in other details, these inventories are not uniform; the most accurate, providing the most statistical details, are the Lviv and Brody ones. Based on these lists, but only on the basis of these, it would be possible to show how many tenements and houses belonged to Jews, in which houses they lived, which cannot be ascertained from other lists. We see, therefore, that in Lviv they were tenants not only of Jewish houses, very often we find them living in the houses of magnates, nobility, burghers, and even the clergy, but mainly they inhabited the Kraków suburb and Podzamcze, forming a kind of their district.

Based on these and other inventories, it would be possible to calculate how many families there were in the parish, how many men, women, how many children, both sons and daughters separately, and even in Wybranówka, how old each child is, how many householders, how many lodgers, how many servants of both sexes; however, since this cannot be stated in all inventories, I give below a list of Jewish heads in the Lviv land and the Żydaczów district, I have limited myself only to giving general figures, without detailed classification, which could not be carried out in all parishes.

These inventories generally list Jews by name; the first and last name is always given first, and usually the occupation of the head of the family, then the names of his other family members and servants. Hence, these inventories fill an entire large folio volume of several hundred pages. To give them here in detail would be pointless, I give only their summary. In general, however, Jewish surnames can be grouped into certain categories, as follows:

1. There are only first names with the addition of a craft or occupation, e.g., Boruch Furman, Szymon Bakalarz, Manel Kantor, Moszko Krawiec, Lewko Belfer;
2. The surname is derived from the father's name, e.g., Lejba Jankielowicz, Dawid Mendlowicz, Aron Moszkowicz;
3. The surname is formed as an adjective,

of the city, thus indicating origin, e.g., Herszko Hodorowski, Szloma Szaranczucki, Herszko Sokalski, Moszko Gologorski.

1. Names such as Lewko Malowany, Mendel Duchowny, Szaja Kulawy, Szloma Krochmal, Marko Hak, probably signifying some attribute, some characteristic feature of the individual concerned.
2. Names ending in -es sounding "Greek", such as: Nechles, Haydles, Dwerles, Cycynes, Hocheles, Freydles, Faygles, Grones, Goldes, Judeles;
3. Ending in -is or -ys, e.g., Raycis, Mekis, Mizys, Minczelis, Peyzys, Hulis, Landys, Baczys;
4. Ending in -as, e.g., Pinkas.
5. Names with German endings, e.g., Tarler, Bryskier.

We do not encounter here any of the "shining and fragrant" names, composed of Gold, Rosen, etc., so widespread today, as they are a product of Austrian conditions.

Finally, such undecided names as, e.g., Pilpel, Sznapek, Dups, Pops, Byx, Hamayda, Rais.

The main occupation of the Jews was brewing and distilling (*propinacja*); in cities we do encounter numerous artisans, and even more Jewish merchants, but in the villages, brewing and distilling seems to have been exclusively in their hands. They are either in breweries, or in inns, or are involved in the wine trade, and that brewing and distilling flourished under their management is evidenced by the fact that in the village of Jaśniska, belonging to the Lviv parish, they had 1 brewery and 10 inns; in general, in all the villages belonging only to the Lviv parish (and there were 43 of these villages), Jews were in 33 inns and 29 breweries.

When calculating individual parishes, I did not rely on the figures given by the commissioners, but tried to verify them; I therefore reviewed all the inventories once again from beginning to end and found that there were mistakes in some places, which I note in the footnotes at the appropriate place. In addition to the individual inventories, there are summaries of the Lviv land and the Żydaczów district at the end, provided with the handwritten signatures of the commissioners. I give them here immediately in full, only in alphabetical order; next to the inventory of the Lviv land, I give the correct figures; the inventory of the Złoczów district remained unchanged, as I found no mistakes in it. Above all, two things are surprising in the Lviv summary: 1) that Dunajów and Pomorzany are omitted in it, even though the detailed inventories of both parishes are in the volume among others; 2) that in the inventory of Wybranówka 166 heads are given, and therefore a poll tax of 332 Polish zlotys, while in the summary there are 250 heads and a poll tax of 500 Polish zlotys; how this happened, why these changes, I cannot explain. By comparing the figures, the differences can be made clear.

1) Korzon (p. 165 note), following Nussbaum, says that e.g., Cyreles = husband of Cyrla, Fajges = husband of Fajga.

2) Today these names all end in -es;

If we compare the figures from the individual inventories with the respective entries in the summary, we see that in total, 91 too many were counted in the inventories, and 886 too few (mainly due to the omission of Dunajów and Pomorzany), and therefore: 795 too few were given in the summary.

The same applies to children under one year old; 7 too many were counted, 49 too few, thus 42 too few.

These figures, as we see, correspond to the difference in sums.

# Summary of Cities in the Żydaczów District

| No. | City with Parish | Heads | Poll Tax (złp.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bolechów | 883 | 1766 |
| 2 | Brzozdowce | 303 | 606 |
| 3 | Chodorów | 426 | 852 |
| 4 | Dolina | 714 | 1428 |
| 5 | Rozdół | 442 | 884 |
| 6 | Różniatów | 239 | 478 |
| 7 | Sokołów | 143 | 286 |
| 8 | Żydaczów | 292 | 584 |
| Sum |  | 3442 | 6884 |

The total number of tax-paying individuals in the Lviv land and the Żydaczów district was 34,995 (Lviv land) + 3442 (Żydaczów) = 38,437. The total poll tax amounted to 69,990 (Lviv land) + 6884 (Żydaczów) = 76,874 Polish zlotys. The total number of souls was 38,437 + 1741 (children in Lviv land where noted) + ? (children in Żydaczów and Lviv land where not noted) = at least 40,178.

It should be noted, however, that in 6 kahals of the Lviv land and in the entire Żydaczów district, children under one year old were not listed, so the number of Jewish souls in the Lviv land could be estimated at least at approximately 42,500.

These figures will gain more life and significance if they are compared with earlier poll tax figures. According to Pawiński (Skarbowość w Polsce za Stefana Batorego. Źródła dziejowe VIII), all Jews in the Crown paid a sum of 6,186 Polish zlotys and 15 groschen in 1569, paying 1 Polish zloty per head, and in 1578, also paying 1 Polish zloty - 10,018 Polish zlotys and groschen. In 1581, a sum of 15,000 Polish zlotys was fixed in advance, which the Crown Jews were obliged to deposit in Warsaw to the treasury official's hands. In 1588, this sum was raised to 20,000 Polish zlotys.

Let's look at more detailed data: in 1578, the poll tax from the Lviv, Halicz, and Żydaczów lands was 1,296 Polish zlotys, from the entire Ruthenian voivodeship 1,796 Polish zlotys; Lviv paid only 600 Polish zlotys at that time, while in 1765 it paid 12,756 Polish zlotys.

Also at the beginning of the 18th century, the difference with the current tariff is enormous.

# Constitution

In the constitution of 1717, the lump sum for the Jewish poll tax was set at 220,000 Polish zlotys, regardless of the number of heads. Now, from this sum, 54,919 Polish zlotys were allocated to the entire Ruthenian voivodeship, while in 1765 from the Żydaczów district alone, 81,062 Polish zlotys were paid. In 1765, from the Lviv land, 81,062 Polish zlotys were paid. Lviv paid 1,480 Polish zlotys at that time, while in 1765, 12,756 Polish zlotys, Żółkiew 329, while in 1765, 4,004 Polish zlotys, Kulików 200, while in 1765, 818 Polish zlotys, and so on in this proportion (Manuscript Ossol. 279, p. 80-106).

If we compare these figures side by side, we must be greatly astonished: either we must assume that the number of Jewish heads was in no way related to the collected poll tax (the constitution of 1764 also emphasizes that much less is collected than could be collected) - or we must accept that in this race there was and is such enormous life energy and reproductive power that the Jews multiplied with immense speed, which the growth of the Christian population undoubtedly could not even equal.

The figures from 1765 compared to the figures from 1578, and even from 1717, are so striking, so obvious, that they could serve for far-reaching conclusions. For the sake of Jewish scholarship, it was necessary for us to soon have calculations of the Jewish population from the entire Republic; let the present list be a small down payment for a start.
