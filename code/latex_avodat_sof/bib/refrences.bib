	abstract = {The present paper contains a model of the social and legal position of Jews in the territory of Poland between the 16th and the 18th centuries. It consists of four elements: 1. With few exceptions, Jews were not permanent inhabitants of Polish villages but through temporary settlement they became — in fact, although not formally — dependent on the feudal authority of the noble proprietors of land estates. 2. Jews — just as other inhabitants of royal towns — were not feudal subjects but in certain towns their rights of ownership were restricted. At the same time, in certain royal towns the dependence of Jews on the civic government had some elements of feudal subjection. 3. Feudal dependency of Jews in the nobility-owned towns had features reminiscent of bondage; however, they indicated a far easier form of bondage than that of peasants. On the other hand, the situation of Jews in the nobility-owned towns was better than in the royal ones, in spite of the fact that in the royal ones the degree of feudal dependency of Jews was much lower. 4. Feudal restraints concerning Jewish right of ownership affected its three elements: possession, disposition and utilization. Tavern keepers in the villages enjoyed only the rights of possession and utilization. A small group of Jewish land-colonists enjoyed the right of possession and exploitation, while their right of disposition was limited. Jews both in the royal and in the nobility-owned towns were restricted only in the way of disposition, concerning the right to sell or to devise realty. The withholding of civil rights and of full rights of ownership from Jews in the first half of the 19th century (in the Warsaw Duchy and in the Polish Kingdom) was a form of continuation of the feudal dependency and of the ownership rights restrictions of the preceding centuries. In the first half of the 19th century, age-old historical and legal memorials were written down to justify and establish the legal restraints of Jews.},

The first Jewish migrants probably entered what became the Kingdom of Poland mainly from south-eastern Europe.

Its consequence was the establishment of a community with an Ashkenazi character, which, over time, became a part of the Ashkenazi cultural sphere. These processes can be observed in the migration of  \textit{takanot}  (halakhic community ordinances) from the French and German lands to the Polish lands.},

Aaron, has occupied an important place in the discussion of the social content of Ḥasidism. Various scholars think that the regulations were made at the convention of the heads of te Kehilot and Rabbis of the region of Nieswiez and of the neighbouring regions, and that both the regulations and the convention itself were the result of the initiative of R. Aaron. They have further accordingly supposed that the Ḥasidic movement in the period of its offensive onslaught made it one of its objects to defend the poorer strata in practice against the social and economic pressure of the heads of the Kehilot. The writer analyses and interprets the details of the document according to the local contemporary circumstances and reaches the conclusion that the regulations are local regulations of the Kehilah of Nieswiez. They are fairly normal and were made according to the usual accepted procedure without any external initiative. It is doubtful if the words of R. Aaron themselves are sufficient to show that he expressed a systematic social and economic criticism of the Kehilah system; much less are they such as to inform us of the Ḥasidic movement in general. A reminiscence of the acts of the emissaries who were then touring the towns and townlets to preach Ḥasidism, has been presserved in the traditions of Ḥasidism and the Misnagdim; had social-economic regulations or even protests been part of their mission, a reminiscence of them would certainly have been preserved in the historical tradition, and particularly in the various polemical writings.},

	volume = {מב},
	issn = {0044-4758},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/23555391},
	abstract = {This article deals with the essential changes which occured in the leadership of the Jewish communities in Russia and their structure during the second half of the 19th century. In the first chapter the author presents a list of phenomena which did not exist in Jewish communities after the partitions of Poland. 1. At the head of the community stood one man and he was named 'the head of the Kahal' or the 'Parnas'. 2. The community leadership which existed during the Polish rule was abolished in the first decades of the 19th century and the number of the members of the community council was reduced to 3—5 individuals. 3. District governors intervened in the election of the 'Parnas' or appointed him. After the intruduction of the 1827 law which made the heads of the communities responsible for the provision of recruits for the army the Jews of Russia experienced a terrible situation, particularly because the law permitted the drafting of young children. The heads of communities did not hesitate to kidnap young children from their mothers and turning them over to the draft officers. As the responsibility for the collection of the taxes was also levied on the 'Kahal' it gave additional power to the heads of communities. In the second chapter the author demonstrates that the essential stimulus of the Russian government for the abolition of the 'Kahal' was the desire to destroy completely the Jewish internal authonomy. As the 'Kahal' was the power inside the community which opposed the aspirations of the Haskalah some Maskilim demanded the abolition of the 'Kahal'. Moses Montefiore during his visit to Russia in 1846 argued in a letter to the Minister of the Interior against the abolition of the 'Kahal'. It seems that in this action he served as a spokesman for rabbis and other comminity leaders. The third chapter deals with the community leadership after the abolition of the 'Kahal' and after the subordination of Jewish matters to the police or to the town councils. The community still possessed some definite rights. The essential one was the authority to assemble in order to make decisions about specific issues and therefore it possessed the authority to make a 'prigovor' (decision) against undesirable individuals either recruiting them to the army or banishing them. Despite the legal abolition of the Kahal the Jewish internal institutions continued to function : the community leadership was held responsible, for the collection of taxes and provision of recruits for the army. Therefore the communities were permitted to appoint a 'sborshchik' which functioned as the tax collection agency. In the larger communities permission was granted to appoint assistants to the tax collector. In regard to conscription into the army the community was given permission to choose a 'starosta', an elder appointed to be in charge of conscription. In judicial matters the law maintained the previous condition i.e. the Jews had the right to arbitration if both sides agreed to be judged by the Jews. In addition to these functions permission was granted to every community ('obshchestvo') to choose 'deputaty' (representatives). The office of the 'deputaty' was found in Lithuania and White Russia in the provinces Kovno, Vilna, Grodno, Minsk. In regard to other areas we have no definite information. In the eyes of the Jews the new body was considered a 'Kahal' and in many communities the 'Sborshchik' was looked upon as the Head of the 'Kahal'. He was either addresed by this name or by the old name 'Parnas Hodesh'. Even the Russian law continued to speak about the 'Kahal' as an established institution. There were also communities which were not run by a more or less defined 'Kahal' but by the 'religious' or 'spiritual' Rabbi and his court i.e. a body which was not recognized as such but it did assemble to discuss matters, give advice, and make certain decisions as the needs arose. (The government appointed as a 'Rabbi' a secular person who served as a registrar of births and deaths). The significance of the 'sborshchik' and the 'starosta' responsible for conscription declined as an outcome of the reform of taxation in 1863. According to this reform, the poll-tax was abolished as well as the mutual responsibility for its payment. The Government imposed instead a tax on property and an income tax. Furthermore, according to the conscription reform enacted in 1874, all twenty one year olds were obligated to serve. The preliminary examination was before a medical board and before a draft board. The actual draft was by lot and according to definite rules. As a result of these reforms the office of the 'deputaty' had all but disappeared. In the eighties in fact it no longer existed even though no official law had been passed abolishing it. The financial source for the support the community institutions was the tax on kosher meat which was contracted every 4 years to tax-farmers and a tax on candles for the maintenance of Russian schools for Jewish children established by the Government in 1844. The budget of every community was fixed by the general town council after consultation with the 'wealthy Jews' of the locale with the confirmation of the administration of the province. But for Jewish institutions and for needs not recognized by the government, for example the maintenance of the 'spiritual' rabbi, there was no officially approved budget. The communities were compelled to find sources to satisfy all these needs by resorting to what was considered as illegal methods. These unrecognized needs and the demands of bribe by local officials prevented community leaders from making public the income and the expenditures of the community. This fact aroused suspicions that the leaders were benefitting from community money. The chapter is concluded with a description of the structure of the relatively new community of Odessa and the communities of St. Petersburg and Moscow which were outside of the Pale of Settlement. In the fourth chapter the author summarizes the changes which followed the abolition of the 'Kahal' in matters of iurisdiction and religion. The authority of the court of the 'spiritual' rabbi was only that of a court of arbitration but the corruption which existed in the Russian judicial system until the reform of the sixties caused even Christians to prefer the court of the Jewish rabbi. In fact, even after the reform Jews and Christians turned to the Rabbi for judicial matters. Communities where the 'deputaty' were not chosen after the abolition of the 'Kahal' were ruled by individuals who imposed their will on the public. But in Vilna, for example, an institution was established called the 'Tzedakah Gedolah' under whose jurisdiction were concentrated all the social services of the community. It was operated by three of the notables in the city. In Mohliev on the Dnieper the community leadership was chosen through democratic elections in which not only the local merchants participated but also the artisans and labourers. After the abolition of the 'Kahal' and the waring of the substitute forms of leadership during the eighties the Jews were caught in an impossible legal position. The 'obshchestvo' was not recognized longer as a juridical body. Just as a single community could not have its own representatives, the Jews as a group did not have the right to have their own representatives. 'Rabbinic Assemblies' which the Minister of the Interior convened at irregular intervals had to contain themselves to answering question which were placed before them by the Government -: their members were not given the right to raise issues which were important to the Jews. The anti-Semites used the lack of Jewish representation to raise libels against the Jews, and to incite the masses against them because there was no body to take them to court.},

	abstract = {The movement of refugees is a difficult task for research. A typical example of the difficulty is our subject matter: the refugees from Germany had to pass on their way to Poland through towns like Leipzig and Breslau and countries like Moravia, which were forbidden territory to them. Indeed, our information on the eastward movement of refugees from the Thirty Years' War comes almost all from Poland and Lithuania, their palce of destination. The first wave of refugees from Bohemia set out for Poland as early as 1619, and others seem to have followed during the war. The whole of Silesian Jewry, several hundred souls, fled and settled on the Polish border. After the fighting was over, virtually all of them returned to their homes. Only a small part of the Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia took to the road as refugees. Most of these, too, probably returned when the fighting died down, for their countries were near Poland and communications were re-established from time to time. The flight of refugees from Germany seems to have begun in the early thirties of the seventeenth century and continued intermittently for about ten years. They came mainly from places that had been fought over for years, i.e. especially from the lands on the Rhein and on the Main. These unfortunates certainly had no hope and no intention of returning immediately after the fighting had died down — they could not in any case do so because the war still continued in their land. In the nature of things they reached first the western part of Poland-Lithuania, and here — in Great Poland and Lithuania, we pick up their traces. They certanily settled down here, like the non-Jewish refugees. The Jewry of Poland-Lithuania, its organisations as well as individuals, took on the task of charity. Men of substance among the refugees were permitted for the time being to settle in communities and earn a living, often with a rebate on taxes; in the course of time a few at least must have been accepted into the communities. The daughters of the refugees at first earned their living as domestic servants, and were later helped with their dowries out of public funds. Their sons were also sent into domestic service, to learn trades, and especially to study Torah — if found fit for it. The acceptance and education of these refugee children as well as of wandering bakhurim is one of the glories of Polish Jewry. As a group the refugees from Germany did not contribute to Jewish life and treasures in Poland. They scattered and were swallowed up completely into the midst of the numerous Jewish society. Since they settled, as we have said, in the western regions of Poland, they were surely untouched by the war of Chmielnicki. They suffered later, as the war dragged on and spread throughout the state. The bakhurim who came to study in the centres of Torah in Poland and Lithuania and settled there, began to return at that time to their families in the land of their birth. We may assume that some refugees did likewise. Those who had studied at the yeshivoth of Poland and Lithuania must have brought back with them to the Jewish centres of Germany the Torah they had learned in Eastern Europe. Along with the returning German refugees, some Polish-born Jews also turned westward, fleeing from the persecutions to Germany. Having dealt kindly in their time with refugees from Germany, they assumed that they deserved the same kindness and consideration.},

	abstract = {the prohibition of usury thus became … the keystone of the political economy of the Middle Ages.Holdsworth (1903, 101)On the morning of July 22, 1306 every Jewish home in France was surrounded by soldiers and bailiffs on the order of the king. The timing was inauspicious: the Jews had concluded the ninth day of the fast of Tisha B'Av, which commemorated the destruction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem in the seventh century BCE and the first century CE respectively. As fate would have it, this date would mark a similar catastrophe for the Jews of France. They were arrested, their possessions seized, and given just one month to leave the realm on pain of death.The writer Ishori Haparchi (1280–1355) was training to be a doctor at the time. He recalled the event as the great tragedy of his age:I was torn from the house of study, forced naked in my youth to leave my father's home, and wandered from land to land, from one nation to another, whose languages were strange to me … I now give the date of destruction of the “small sanctuary,” that is the destruction of the schools and synagogues in France and part of Provence, when I took flight from the battle. Through our sins, it took place in the year 5066, in the month of retribution. (quoted in Golb, 1998, 538)In this chapter we describe how the 1306 expulsion of French Jews was related to the new political equilibrium between church and state that emerged in Europe after 1100.The 1306 French expulsion, and the many other incidents like it, reflect the nature of the conditional toleration equilibrium that emerged in medieval Europe. The alliance between political and religious authorities had two consequences. First, rulers began to persecute religious minorities when this could buttress their sacred credentials. Second, when it was too costly to eliminate the religious minority, states would instead attempt to separate them from the rest of society. In other words, the state would conditionally tolerate the religiously deviant groups.In this chapter, we describe how this conditional toleration equilibrium applied to Europe's Jewish communities, focusing on why it was self-enforcing, how it also reinforced antisemitism, and how it could break down, resulting in tragedies such as the expulsions of 1306.},

	abstract = {Medieval Europe's rent-seeking equilibrium enabled Jews to settle and often to flourish. However, it also left them highly vulnerable to the whims of rulers and to both local elites and commoners who resented their fiscal role. Antisemitic beliefs were deeply rooted in medieval culture, but they manifested themselves most strongly when economic conditions deteriorated. We now describe how these factors combined to bring about a crisis for Jewish communities after 1300.Already by the end of the thirteenth century the situation of Europe's Jewish communities had deteriorated, but the fourteenth century – a century of plague, warfare, and famine for the entire continent – was nothing short of catastrophic. First, in 1290 England's small Jewish community was expelled wholesale by Edward I. Then, in 1306 Philip IV of France expelled the Jews of France. Though they were invited to resettle a decade later by his son, the unrest that followed the Great Famine of 1315–1321 saw a series of pogroms across the country. Numerous pogroms also took place in the German lands during this period, but these pale in comparison to the Europe-wide persecutions that commenced with the Black Death (1347–1352), which we discuss in Chapter 6.In this chapter we seek to explain why the conditional toleration equilibrium was particularly fragile in societies whose economies were close to subsistence and where political authority was weak. We test this argument by identifying the impact of economic shocks on the conditional toleration equilibrium using random fluctuations in growing season temperatures across European cities. We then use these temperature fluctuations to probe under what sorts of geographic and institutional constraints the conditional toleration equilibrium was more or less stable.Agricultural output in medieval Europe was highly dependent on weather patterns. Farmers did not have access to chemical fertilizers or scientific agronomy. Storage technologies were underdeveloped and transporting grain over long distance expensive. The risk of harvest failure due to climatic fluctuations was very real. In Bruce Campbell's evocative words, nature was a “historical protagonist.”This vulnerability was heightened by the early fourteenth century, as Europe was densely settled by the standards of a preindustrial economy. During the previous two centuries of economic and demographic expansion, forests had been cut down, marshes drained, and marginal land taken into cultivation.With a population of around 80 million, the continent was close to its Malthusian carrying capacity.},

Not only did the tightly knit quality of medieval Jewish communities promote a confluence of overlapping interests and pursuits among its constituents, but more to the point, the very nature of Jewish life blurs, if not belies altogether, the distinction between the religious and the economic. Those mundane functions that, to the majority culture, appear unmarked in relation to religion are, in the Jewish experience, part and parcel of it. The two realms collapse together, because Jews understand the spiritual realm of their religion as one expression of their national existence, which naturally includes economic and social organization within it. Under normal circumstances, the members of a given community required a series of specifically Jewish services and products that met local standards for such disparate concerns as: kosher edibles, capable scholars, scribes and emergency funds for the redemption of captives, to name a few. In order to provide these necessities for uniquely, or almost uniquely, Jewish consumption, communities demanded an entire network based on the proffering of and compensation for these services and goods.This economy, here dubbed the inner economy, is defined by its inward orientation. It assumes Jewish preparation and production of goods, and training for services, specifically for the benefit of Jews.},

	abstract = {The Jews of Byzantium engaged economically with society in a number of ways, but consistently over the centuries they committed the bulk of their resources to two realms: taxes and textiles. The first of these, taxation, poses significant problems of definition, because the uniformity of sources declines sharply between the early and middle periods. This lack of clear-cut and abundant evidence in the seventh and subsequent centuries has resulted in a longstanding dispute regarding taxation of the Jews. Scholars question if a special Jewish tax existed, or if the Jews were simply subject to the same burden of taxation as all others in the realm. A resolution to this decades-old debate deserves some attention, but the problem itself, posed thus, only tangentially serves the overarching task of analyzing economic relationships as reflective of civic and social ones. In different fashion, the mode of taxation, i.e., collective or individual, might more accurately suggest the standing of the Jews vis-à-vis the fisc, a posture that not only represents the official relationship to the government but also – indirectly and symbolically – the Jewish place in society. Even analyzed through this lens, however, the official nature of taxation cannot illustrate the day-to-day encounters among people and groups, as other aspects of the economy can do.Unlike taxation, which recognizes first and foremost the subject–state relationship, Byzantine-Jewish manufacturing and commerce evolved in the context of a bustling marketplace, both in Byzantium and beyond.},

	abstract = {The form of taxation, its apportionment and the methods of its collection constituted one of the most important factors in the Jewish communal organization. It had a special significance in the Ottoman Empire since in each town "congregations" developed made up of people of different places of origin, the cohesion of which was affected to a considerable extent by the taxation. A. Head tax. In the period that concerns us the earlier Moslem usage of distinguishing between the rich, those of medium means and the poor was abolished. It was in force in the days of R. Eliyahu Mizrahi (who died c. 1525) who recorded that the taxes had been increased, presumably because of the war between Selim I and the Mamelukes. A levelling of the classes was introduced at the beginning of the reign of Suliman. Contrary to Moslem law, under which every male of 15 and over was liable, heads of families became equally liable without the number of adult males being taken into account. Bachelors who did not belong to any family were liable. Those liable were registered, though the tax was not collected from the individual, but from the community as a whole. The community would come to an agreement with the tax officials as to an overall amount and then make its own internal assessments as it saw fit. The community authorities would try to prevent the taking of new censuses so as not to increase the number of people registered. But there was also an opposite situation. Communities whose population decreased had to pay in accordance with prior censuses. In Saloniki, as well as in the other communities, each congregation was registered separately, but the tax was paid by all the congregations as one unit. Saloniki had a special problem, since apart from the ordinary taxes it had to provide to the Imperial Court 7,800 head of cattle and clothing material for the army. The rich had to provide silver bars for the mint, for which purpose they employed workers in the silver mines at Sidro-Kafsi near Saloniki. In 1566 a deputation to Constantinople succeeded in obtaining a firman freeing the community from the cattle tribute and the rich from providing silver, and also abolishing the head tax. In place of these, a general tax was levied on the community of 50,000 aspers annually paid in a lump sum (300,000 aspers) for six years in advance. On the death of Selim II, who had issued the firman, this arrangement was cancelled; the census of 1613 shows that all males of 15 and over were liable to tax. B. Rabbi's tax. With the appointment of R. Moshe Kapsali as Chief Rabbi of Turkey this tax was instituted for the maintenance of a High Religious Authority for the entire communities in Turkey. All the comunities in the Empire were subject to the tax. Presumably the Chief Rabbi divided the total among all the communities, collecting it and transmitting it to the Imperial Treasury. It seems that communities formed after institution of the tax were not called on to pay. C. Other taxes. Various taxes were imposed on the Jews, in times of emergency for example, and imposts on the slaughtering of animals for food and on betrothals (payable by the bride). The Hawarid tax was first imposed for times of emergency, but became permanent. Those liable were divided into groups each of which was liable for a certain amount or for a certain delivery to the army. In Constantinople and some other places this tax was assessed per head, but elsewhere per house. There was also a tax for owning slaves and maidservants. There was no property tax in Turkey; and not a few people paid no taxes at all. There are sources therefore that speak of the Sultans as benevolent rulers. In the seventies of the 16th century things worsened, perhaps because of the war with Venice. Payments of the Cadi, the Police Chief and the Governor of the city became officially recognized. In addition, it became necessary to pay bribes and "gifts" to officials, particularly to collectors and census-takers D. Community taxes. The main expenditures of the community were for support of the poor and maintenance of the Talmud Torah. Other items were for clothes for poor students on the Hanukah festival, maintenance of the synagogue, the public bathhouse and the cemetery, visiting the sick, ransoming prisoners, and hospitality for travellers. A considerable part of these expenses was covered by fund-drives and personal contributions. The heads of the "congregations" did not look favorably on the establishment of societies, which they feared might lead to disruption. Direct taxation for community needs was not an important factor in the congregation budget. Some made an impost to cover the salaries of the rabbis. There is evidence also of such taxes as gabelio on meat and on exported wares. In Saloniki there was a tax on combed wool. E. Congregational organization. This differed from place to place. In Constantinople a member of one congregation could transfer to another, which was a difficult procedure in Saloniki where it would have created a problem: the departure of a member would leave a greater burden on the others. The communities placed the weight of taxation or most of it on property — a system of great social significance. It was democratic to a considerable degree and the Government did not interfere in it. Among the sages some made no distinction between rich and poor while others did, not because of social distinction but because they considered that only the taxpayers should have a voice in community affairs connected with the tax. It appears that there was a tendency to enhance the authorily of the appointed representatives, this because of the constant agitation in the public and the social tensions that led to splits in the congregations. By usage inherited from Spain, the representatives were usually elected for one-year terms and from among three groups — the rich, the middle class and the poor, each choosing from among its own group, this in order to minimize internal friction. The assessors were appointed by general meeting of the taxpayers, though in some places other methods were used: for example, the congressional representatives might also act as assessors. In the large communities the assessors operated in groups of three, each group maintainning a register. The final assessment was an average of all the separate assessments. In places where there were several congregations there was a distinction between the "overall assessment" of each "congregation" and fixing of its share of the common taxation burden of the congregations on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the "private assessment" of each congregation for fixing its share in the special taxes and in the commonly contributed taxes. In Saloniki the "overall assessment" was usually carried out every ten years and the "private assessment" usually every three years. Property tax was payable "on silver and gold and coin and land and goods". It was not leired on household chattels or clothing. In Saloniki jewellery, gold and silver utensils, maidservants, animals and books were assessed at half their value. Public officials, synagogue beadles and cantors were not liable to taxation, as was the case also with full-time teachers of Torah. In Constantinople and Saloniki there was an upper limit: a person with very large assets paid tax only on part. By edict of the Sultan some very wealthy families were granted complete exemption.},

R. Joseph Ergas of Livorno and R. Samson Morpurgo of Ancona, who took somewhat different stands during the Luzzatto controversy, had earlier responded quite differently when, during the 1720s, a conflict broke out between the leaders of Salonika's Jewish community and the Italian Jewish merchants residing there. The latter resisted a new communal decree which required them to grow their beards long in accordance with local custom. Ergas upheld the decree whereas Morpurgo ruled that although kabbalistic grounds where evinced for this custom, it was more a matter of social practice; the Jews of Islamic countries "since earliest days" grew their beards long like their neighbors, while those of Christian Europe where accustomed to a more cleanshaven look. The paper examines, more generally, the tensions in early eighteenth-century Europe between adherence to kabbalistic practice and the desire among many Jews to avoid appearing exotically Levantine. /// [Abstract in Hebrew].},

Integration on the part of the Italians proceeded for the most part by their providing loyal service and establishing patron-client relations with their paymasters, and by staying in touch with one another in a network of mutual assistance. Crucial importance in the process of integration through assimilation within an adopted country must be ascribed to the mixed marriages concluded between Italian men and local women.

	abstract = {A pregnant mother, a teacher who had fallen ill, a
thirty-year-old homeless thief, refugees from war-torn communities, orphans, widows, the mentally disabled and domestic servants. What this diverse group of individuals-mentioned in a wide range of
manuscript and print sources in German, Hebrew, and Yiddish-had in common was their appeal to early modern Jewish communities for aid. Poor relief administrators, confronted with multiple requests and a finite communal budget, were forced to decide who would receive
support and how much, and who would not. Then as now, observes
Debra Kaplan, public charity tells us about both donors and
recipients, revealing the values, perceptions, roles in society,
and the dynamics of power that existed between those who gave and those who received.

In  \textit{The Patrons and Their Poor} , Kaplan offers the first
extensive analysis of Jewish poor relief in early modern German
cities and towns, focusing on three major urban Ashkenazic Jewish communities from the Western part of the Holy Roman Empire:
Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbek, Frankfurt am Main, and Worms. She
demonstrates how Jewish charitable institutions became increasingly formalized as Jewish authorities faced a growing number of people seeking aid amid limited resources. Kaplan explores the
intersections between various sectors of the population, from
wealthy patrons to the homeless and stateless poor, providing an
intimate portrait of the early modern Ashkenazic community.},

	title = {Leadership of the {Jewish} {Communities} in {Russia} after the {Abolition} of the '{Kahal}' / ההנהגה בקהילות רוסיה עם ביטול ה'קהל'},
	volume = {מב},
	issn = {0044-4758},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/23555391},
	abstract = {This article deals with the essential changes which occured in the leadership of the Jewish communities in Russia and their structure during the second half of the 19th century. In the first chapter the author presents a list of phenomena which did not exist in Jewish communities after the partitions of Poland. 1. At the head of the community stood one man and he was named 'the head of the Kahal' or the 'Parnas'. 2. The community leadership which existed during the Polish rule was abolished in the first decades of the 19th century and the number of the members of the community council was reduced to 3—5 individuals. 3. District governors intervened in the election of the 'Parnas' or appointed him. After the intruduction of the 1827 law which made the heads of the communities responsible for the provision of recruits for the army the Jews of Russia experienced a terrible situation, particularly because the law permitted the drafting of young children. The heads of communities did not hesitate to kidnap young children from their mothers and turning them over to the draft officers. As the responsibility for the collection of the taxes was also levied on the 'Kahal' it gave additional power to the heads of communities. In the second chapter the author demonstrates that the essential stimulus of the Russian government for the abolition of the 'Kahal' was the desire to destroy completely the Jewish internal authonomy. As the 'Kahal' was the power inside the community which opposed the aspirations of the Haskalah some Maskilim demanded the abolition of the 'Kahal'. Moses Montefiore during his visit to Russia in 1846 argued in a letter to the Minister of the Interior against the abolition of the 'Kahal'. It seems that in this action he served as a spokesman for rabbis and other comminity leaders. The third chapter deals with the community leadership after the abolition of the 'Kahal' and after the subordination of Jewish matters to the police or to the town councils. The community still possessed some definite rights. The essential one was the authority to assemble in order to make decisions about specific issues and therefore it possessed the authority to make a 'prigovor' (decision) against undesirable individuals either recruiting them to the army or banishing them. Despite the legal abolition of the Kahal the Jewish internal institutions continued to function : the community leadership was held responsible, for the collection of taxes and provision of recruits for the army. Therefore the communities were permitted to appoint a 'sborshchik' which functioned as the tax collection agency. In the larger communities permission was granted to appoint assistants to the tax collector. In regard to conscription into the army the community was given permission to choose a 'starosta', an elder appointed to be in charge of conscription. In judicial matters the law maintained the previous condition i.e. the Jews had the right to arbitration if both sides agreed to be judged by the Jews. In addition to these functions permission was granted to every community ('obshchestvo') to choose 'deputaty' (representatives). The office of the 'deputaty' was found in Lithuania and White Russia in the provinces Kovno, Vilna, Grodno, Minsk. In regard to other areas we have no definite information. In the eyes of the Jews the new body was considered a 'Kahal' and in many communities the 'Sborshchik' was looked upon as the Head of the 'Kahal'. He was either addresed by this name or by the old name 'Parnas Hodesh'. Even the Russian law continued to speak about the 'Kahal' as an established institution. There were also communities which were not run by a more or less defined 'Kahal' but by the 'religious' or 'spiritual' Rabbi and his court i.e. a body which was not recognized as such but it did assemble to discuss matters, give advice, and make certain decisions as the needs arose. (The government appointed as a 'Rabbi' a secular person who served as a registrar of births and deaths). The significance of the 'sborshchik' and the 'starosta' responsible for conscription declined as an outcome of the reform of taxation in 1863. According to this reform, the poll-tax was abolished as well as the mutual responsibility for its payment. The Government imposed instead a tax on property and an income tax. Furthermore, according to the conscription reform enacted in 1874, all twenty one year olds were obligated to serve. The preliminary examination was before a medical board and before a draft board. The actual draft was by lot and according to definite rules. As a result of these reforms the office of the 'deputaty' had all but disappeared. In the eighties in fact it no longer existed even though no official law had been passed abolishing it. The financial source for the support the community institutions was the tax on kosher meat which was contracted every 4 years to tax-farmers and a tax on candles for the maintenance of Russian schools for Jewish children established by the Government in 1844. The budget of every community was fixed by the general town council after consultation with the 'wealthy Jews' of the locale with the confirmation of the administration of the province. But for Jewish institutions and for needs not recognized by the government, for example the maintenance of the 'spiritual' rabbi, there was no officially approved budget. The communities were compelled to find sources to satisfy all these needs by resorting to what was considered as illegal methods. These unrecognized needs and the demands of bribe by local officials prevented community leaders from making public the income and the expenditures of the community. This fact aroused suspicions that the leaders were benefitting from community money. The chapter is concluded with a description of the structure of the relatively new community of Odessa and the communities of St. Petersburg and Moscow which were outside of the Pale of Settlement. In the fourth chapter the author summarizes the changes which followed the abolition of the 'Kahal' in matters of iurisdiction and religion. The authority of the court of the 'spiritual' rabbi was only that of a court of arbitration but the corruption which existed in the Russian judicial system until the reform of the sixties caused even Christians to prefer the court of the Jewish rabbi. In fact, even after the reform Jews and Christians turned to the Rabbi for judicial matters. Communities where the 'deputaty' were not chosen after the abolition of the 'Kahal' were ruled by individuals who imposed their will on the public. But in Vilna, for example, an institution was established called the 'Tzedakah Gedolah' under whose jurisdiction were concentrated all the social services of the community. It was operated by three of the notables in the city. In Mohliev on the Dnieper the community leadership was chosen through democratic elections in which not only the local merchants participated but also the artisans and labourers. After the abolition of the 'Kahal' and the waring of the substitute forms of leadership during the eighties the Jews were caught in an impossible legal position. The 'obshchestvo' was not recognized longer as a juridical body. Just as a single community could not have its own representatives, the Jews as a group did not have the right to have their own representatives. 'Rabbinic Assemblies' which the Minister of the Interior convened at irregular intervals had to contain themselves to answering question which were placed before them by the Government -: their members were not given the right to raise issues which were important to the Jews. The anti-Semites used the lack of Jewish representation to raise libels against the Jews, and to incite the masses against them because there was no body to take them to court.},

In the academic language, the word “pinkas” is applied not only to the communal minute books and minute books of the communal bodies but also to private minute books. The article deals with the development of this category of sources which evolved from private minute books dating back to at least the 11th century to the communal ones as well as the minute books of the communal bodies based on the dozen manuscript examples. These are mostly of European origin, however, with a few Eastern additions. This evolution process becomes visible as a result of the analysis of the manuscripts’ internal structure and composition. Special attention is paid to the techniques used to enforce this structure on codicological and paleographic levels. The data at hand suggest that at the beginning of the Modern period some of the minute books were shifted from private to the public domain. This was a response to the demand from the rapidly evolving communal institutions. To suit the widened audience of varying backgrounds the communal minute books compared to those for private use adopted a more uniform structure as well as with a set of “navigation” or referencing tools, such as captions written on margins. The early modern Italian communal minute books tend to be the most structured ones.},

In the eighteenth century, more than half of the world's Jewish population lived in Polish private villages and towns owned by magnate-aristocrats. Furthermore, roughly half of Poland's entire urban population was Jewish. Thus, the study of Jews in private Polish towns is central to both Jewish history and to the history of Poland-Lithuania. The Jews in a Polish Private Town seeks to investigate the social, economic, and political history of Jews in Opatów, a private Polish town, in the context of an increasing power and influence of private towns at the expense of the Polish crown and gentry in the eighteenth century. Hundert recovers an important community from historical obscurity by providing a balanced perspective on the Jewish experience in the Polish Commonwealth and by describing the special dimensions of Jewish life in a private town.},

Moreover, they are very important for benchmarking processing algorithms. Numerous publicly available document image datasets of different languages have been emerged. However, current segmentation and recognition performances are nearly saturated with respect to the present publicly available datasets. As such, collecting and labelling historical document images is a burden on historical document image processing researchers. This paper introduces a public historical document image dataset, Pinkas dataset, with new challenges to open room for improvement and identify strengths and weaknesses of available processing algorithms. It is the first dataset in medieval handwritten Hebrew and fully labeled at word, line and page level by an expert of historical Hebrew manuscripts. Pinkas dataset contributes to the diversity of benchmarking standards. In this paper we present meta features of Pinkas dataset and apply recent word spotting algorithms to analyze the room for improvement in terms of performance.},

	abstract = {Boundaries—physical, political, social, religious, and cultural—were a key feature of life in medieval and early modern Poland, and this volume focuses on the ways in which these boundaries were respected, crossed, or otherwise negotiated. It throws new light on the contacts between Jews and Poles, including the vexed question of conversion and the tensions it aroused. The collected articles also discuss relations between the various elements of Jewish society—the wealthy and the poor, the educated and the uneducated, and the religious and the lay elites, considering too contacts between Jews in Poland and those in Germany and elsewhere. Classic studies by such eminent scholars as Meir Bałaban, Jacob Goldberg, and Moshe Rosman provide a foil for new research by Hanna Zaremska and David Frick, as well as Adam Teller, Magda Teter, Elisheva Carlebach, Jürgen Heyde, and Adam Kaźmierczyk. Taken together, the contributions on this central theme help redefine the Jewish history of pre-modern Poland. As ever, the New Views section examines a wide variety of other topics. These include accusations of ritual murder in nineteenth-century Poland; the Russian Jewish integrationist politician Mikhail Morgulis; the attitude of Bolesław Prus towards Jewish assimilation and his relationship with the Jewish journalist Nahum Sokolow; women in the Mizrahi movement in Poland; Polish patriotism among Jews; the impact of the first Soviet occupation of 1939–41 on Polish–Jewish relations; how the war affected the views of Julian Tuwim and Antoni Słonimski; the shtetl in the work of American Jewish writers Allen Hoffman and Jonathan Safran Foer; and the initial Polish response to Jan Gross's Fear.},

	abstract = {Among the principal misfortunes suffered by Jews in Poland during the middle of the 17th century was the capture and imprisonment of some of them by various armed troops, frequently invading the country. The Tartar looting and capturing raids increased in frequency during the 17th century, and particularly during the Khanship of Islam Girey (1644–1652), the ally of Chmelnitzky at the time of the Cosack uprisings. On the basis of Jewish, Polish, Ukrainian and Tartar sources, the author draws a picture of the captures made by the Tartars among Polish Jews throughout the campaigns of 1648–53. His analysis shows that during this entire period the only captors were the Tartars, whereas in the years 1654–5 and 1659 — the Moscovites. The author then proceeds to describe the trek of the captured Jews to the Crimea, and from there to various slave markets, and especially that of Constantinople. Finally he deals with the efforts of the Constantinople community and other Jewish communities for the redemption of the captives. Redemption of captives started among the Jews much earlier. Special collections were organized and permanent institutions for the redemption of captives existed in several of the central cities of the Ottoman Empire, Italy, Germany, Bohemia and Poland. Particularly prominent in this respect were in various times the communities of Venice, Constiantinople and Lublin which constituted also centres of fund-collection for the Holy Land. According to the author's analysis, the community of Constantinople made the main contribution towards the release of the captives of 1648–49. Contrary to exaggerations of the number of the redeemed common in chronicles, the author, on the basis of various printed and MS sources concludes that they were, until the middle fifties of the 17th century, over 2,000 in Constantinople. Owing to the size of the financial burden and the urgency of the matter, letters and special emissaries were sent out from Constantinople to various countries to collect money for this purpose. Moshe Zacuto and Shemuel Aboab in Italy were active in this field, both in their own country and abroad. Several communities in Germany and Holland, as well as central Jewish institutions in Poland and Lithuania, made and sought contributions to this end. Various sources, hint at similar activity in Vienna, Poznań, Belgrade, as well as Alexandria in Egypt and among the Jews of North Africa. Part of the Jews captured by the Moscovites in the fifties reached Persia as slaves, and from there sent appeals for help as well as emissaries to the Jewish communities of Poland, Italy and Constantinople. It appears that the drive for the redemption of the Polish captives (which involved a tremendous expenditure, as the redemption fee was much higher than the market price of a slave) continued uninterruptedly until close to the general Messianic movement of Shabbetai Zevi (1666). The author poses, on the basis of contemporary evidence, the question whether we do not have to reckon with a connection in the minds of people between their activities on behalf of the Polish captives and the belief that they might thus hasten the approach of the redemption of the people of Israel.

	abstract = {The resettlement of Jews in Breslau after their expulsion in 1453 was said to have taken place in 1630 when the Emperor Ferdinand II granted a charter to some Jews permitting them to dwell in the city's suburbs (F. A. Zimmemann) and M. Brann quotes a muncipal decision of 1635 allowing Jews to enter the city from time to time. The author did not find any trace of the charter in the Breslau State and Municipal Archives. On the other hand foreign Jews are mentioned in 1635 when the Municipal Council restricted the number of days on which the Jews might attend the fair and reserved the right to allow the entry of individual Jews into the city in wartime for the benefit of the city. It is obvious that this enabled them to visit the town only for limited periods and by special permit even when there was no fair. The merchants, fearing the competition of the Jews, petitioned against this ordinance but were opposed by the various guilds, who depended on the Jewish buyers and their orders. Actually the resettlement dates from 1656 when Zacharias Lazarus from Náchod (Bohemia) was made official supplier of silver and gold to the Imperial Mint in Breslau in order to overcome the shortage caused by the Thirty Years War. The opposition of the merchants, who had previously prevented the permanent settlement of Jewish suppliers to the mint, was now overcome in consequence of the growing influence of the central authorities. The synagogue which Lazarus established in his house was the first place of worship and existed until 1938. The settlement of the Jews in the suburbs of Breslau dates from 1665—1667. These communities were recognized by the authorities whereas the community of Breslau attained official status only after the Prussian occupation in 1744.},

	abstract = {On the basis of much archival material — both from government sources and from individuals active in this matter — supplemented by material published in the press of the time and place, the writer reconstructs the attempts to settle Jews on the land in the 'Kingdom of Poland' under Russian sovereignty in approximately 1843 to 1862. He revives the actual achievements and shortcomings of this movement and comes to the conclusion that the achievements were relatively considerable, although the circumstances of the economy and society and prevalent views concerning Polish-Jewish relations of the period stood in the way of greater success. In 1863, there were 30,000 Jewish farmers in the Kingdom of Poland. Ten of their villages were model communities in the Polish agricultural environment. In the course of the survey, the attitude of the Jewish advocates of Enlightenment and the wealthy Jews on the one hand and of most of the Polish landed gentry on the other to this problem becomes clear. Two personalities are particularly conspicuous for their devotion to and preoccupation with this matter — the Pole Władysław Garbiński and the Jew Mattiasz Rosen. Their standing in this matter and views are clarified in the correspondence between them which is given in the Polish original in Appendix A (1—4), p. 63. In Appendix B (p. 70) the constitution of the Society for the Encouragement of the Jews in the Kingdom of Poland is given. Appendix C (p. 74) contains the circular which the Agricultural Society in the Kingdom of Poland sent to its correspondent members in March, 1861, with regard to the question under discussion. The enthusiastic Polish poem by Alexander Kraushar in praise of Jewish settlement on the land deserves mention; it is published here anew in the original, Note 49, p.},

	abstract = {The author opposes the accepted assertion that Lithuanian Jewry was directly connected with the Council of Four Lands till 1623, and that only then did they separate and found their own Council. He bases his opinion that the Lithuanian Council already existed before then, on a number of the Council's statutes of 1623 wherein are mentioned previous statutes and accounts, and also an "old pinkas". A fragment, found in manuscript form, of a series of statutes belonging to the Council — the document is given in full in the article — he takes to be a remnant of this old pinkas. The fragment is undated, but from the identification of persons mentioned in it, and from other evidence, the author ascribes it to the sixties of the sixteenth century. On this evidence he decides that the council was already in existence at that time. The second problem discussed is: was the Lithuanian Council, during the period of the old pinkas (i.e. before August 1623), a member of the Council of Four Lands which, as is known, was a federative body and united in it several Councils? With reference to this period, the author enriches us with a new document previously ascribed to 1633 but which, in view of chronological and factual evidence brought by him, he ascribes to March 1623. On the evidence of this document and in accordance with all the rest of the data, brought by A. A. Harkavi, on the relations between Lithuanian Jewry and the Council of Four Lands, the author comes to the conclusion that the Lithuanian Council was an independent body. Definite connections, however, were maintained with the Council of Four Lands for the arrangement of affairs of mutual interest, e.g. the revocation of oppressive decrees and the refutation of false accusations, the "expenses" for the members of the Polish parliament and its presidents, the arrangement of Jewish affairs at the large fairs in Lublin etc. These connections were oftimes weaker or stronger; but in general, there was no qualitative difference between the period of the old pinkas and that of the new one.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to examine the stages in the development of the 'Council of Four Lands' (Vaad Arba Arazot), an institution of vital importance in the shaping and strengthening of Jewish self-government in Poland and Lithuania four hundred years ago. Prolonged attempts at communication between representatives of the major communities (and 'circuits' — gelilim) led to the formation of the Council. It served as a regulatory body among the communities, frequently resolving disputes of a legal or fiscal nature. The Council also instituted regulations aimed at solving extraordinary and complicated problems that transcended the competence or authority of any single community. Upon reaching an advanced stage of organization, with full recognition and cooperation extended by the highest institutions of the land, the Council would also serve as mediator in disputes between the institutions of the Jewish community and those of the government. The accomplishments of the representatives of the Jewish community were achieved thanks to a particular constellation of circumstances. The author examines these conditions in the light of government documents as well as private ones. Particular attention is given to an analysis of the Jewish role in collecting state revenue by means of contracting monopolies on salt mining and distribution, production and merchandising of beverages, the leasing of responsibility for collecting customs duty and the minting of coins. Socially and politically these occupations were extremely sensitive areas during the reign of Stephan Batory, due to the latter's military undertakings against Moscovite Russia.},

	abstract = {Among the principal misfortunes suffered by Jews in Poland during the middle of the 17th century was the capture and imprisonment of some of them by various armed troops, frequently invading the country. The Tartar looting and capturing raids increased in frequency during the 17th century, and particularly during the Khanship of Islam Girey (1644–1652), the ally of Chmelnitzky at the time of the Cosack uprisings. On the basis of Jewish, Polish, Ukrainian and Tartar sources, the author draws a picture of the captures made by the Tartars among Polish Jews throughout the campaigns of 1648–53. His analysis shows that during this entire period the only captors were the Tartars, whereas in the years 1654–5 and 1659 — the Moscovites. The author then proceeds to describe the trek of the captured Jews to the Crimea, and from there to various slave markets, and especially that of Constantinople. Finally he deals with the efforts of the Constantinople community and other Jewish communities for the redemption of the captives. Redemption of captives started among the Jews much earlier. Special collections were organized and permanent institutions for the redemption of captives existed in several of the central cities of the Ottoman Empire, Italy, Germany, Bohemia and Poland. Particularly prominent in this respect were in various times the communities of Venice, Constiantinople and Lublin which constituted also centres of fund-collection for the Holy Land. According to the author's analysis, the community of Constantinople made the main contribution towards the release of the captives of 1648–49. Contrary to exaggerations of the number of the redeemed common in chronicles, the author, on the basis of various printed and MS sources concludes that they were, until the middle fifties of the 17th century, over 2,000 in Constantinople. Owing to the size of the financial burden and the urgency of the matter, letters and special emissaries were sent out from Constantinople to various countries to collect money for this purpose. Moshe Zacuto and Shemuel Aboab in Italy were active in this field, both in their own country and abroad. Several communities in Germany and Holland, as well as central Jewish institutions in Poland and Lithuania, made and sought contributions to this end. Various sources, hint at similar activity in Vienna, Poznań, Belgrade, as well as Alexandria in Egypt and among the Jews of North Africa. Part of the Jews captured by the Moscovites in the fifties reached Persia as slaves, and from there sent appeals for help as well as emissaries to the Jewish communities of Poland, Italy and Constantinople. It appears that the drive for the redemption of the Polish captives (which involved a tremendous expenditure, as the redemption fee was much higher than the market price of a slave) continued uninterruptedly until close to the general Messianic movement of Shabbetai Zevi (1666).

	abstract = {The dispute described broke out in 1615, a short while after the Jews, expelled from Frankfurt as a result of Fettmilch's revolt, had returned to the city. It ended in 1628. Essentially the dispute was a bitter struggle against the Jewish Community Council, whose members held their posts for life and even elected new members to fill any vacancies. The opposition demanded a more popularly-based règime, after the manner of Prague: they wanted the Kehilla Council to be elected by the whole community, for a limited period only, and they wanted to forbid the election of close relatives. The opposition also demanded the restoration of the full administrative and judicial autonomy previously enjoyed by the Jews, which had been curtailed by the City Council on account of the dispute. In addition to the City Council, which took a very active part in the proceedings, the dispute involved the Emperor and his representatives on one hand, and Rabbis and Jewish institutions inside and outside Germany on the other hand, especially the Synod of the Four Lands in Poland. The Polish Synod which then occupied the greatest authority in the Jewish world, supported the opposition on grounds of principle. It threatened to ban the heads of the Frankfurt community, claiming that their tenure of office was unlawful. This threat was, in fact, subsequently carried out. The Polish Synod also threatened to use sanctions against German Jews entering or residing in Poland. The dispute ended in a compromise, which provided for the immediate restoration of administrative and judicial autonomy, and a gradual democratization to take place over a period of some years. Lastly, the author considers the possible connection between the struggle of Frankfurt Jewry against their existing oligarchy, and the revolt against the City Council which preceded it — the very revolt which had led, among other things, to the expulsion of the Jews from the city. The question is also raised of the evolution of the Frankfurt Community and of other Communities in Germany, towards a more oligarchic structure, as compared with such Jewish Communities as those of Poland and Bohemia. Several hitherto unpublished Hebrew documents are appended to the article, as well as the text of the intervention of the Synod of the Four Lands and the Prague Community in the dispute under discussion.},

	abstract = {The author opposes the accepted assertion that Lithuanian Jewry was directly connected with the Council of Four Lands till 1623, and that only then did they separate and found their own Council. He bases his opinion that the Lithuanian Council already existed before then, on a number of the Council's statutes of 1623 wherein are mentioned previous statutes and accounts, and also an "old pinkas". A fragment, found in manuscript form, of a series of statutes belonging to the Council — the document is given in full in the article — he takes to be a remnant of this old pinkas. The fragment is undated, but from the identification of persons mentioned in it, and from other evidence, the author ascribes it to the sixties of the sixteenth century. On this evidence he decides that the council was already in existence at that time. The second problem discussed is: was the Lithuanian Council, during the period of the old pinkas (i.e. before August 1623), a member of the Council of Four Lands which, as is known, was a federative body and united in it several Councils? With reference to this period, the author enriches us with a new document previously ascribed to 1633 but which, in view of chronological and factual evidence brought by him, he ascribes to March 1623. On the evidence of this document and in accordance with all the rest of the data, brought by A. A. Harkavi, on the relations between Lithuanian Jewry and the Council of Four Lands, the author comes to the conclusion that the Lithuanian Council was an independent body. Definite connections, however, were maintained with the Council of Four Lands for the arrangement of affairs of mutual interest, e.g. the revocation of oppressive decrees and the refutation of false accusations, the "expenses" for the members of the Polish parliament and its presidents, the arrangement of Jewish affairs at the large fairs in Lublin etc. These connections were oftimes weaker or stronger; but in general, there was no qualitative difference between the period of the old pinkas and that of the new one.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/23550316},
	abstract = {In 1835, the Russian government was preparing a law forbidding the marriage of Jewish under-age persons of both sexes and establishing severe penalties for all violators, including the married couple and their relatives. When news of this reached the Jews, who regarded early marriages as desirable from the point of view of religion and morality, they rushed in masses to marry off their sons and daughters, even small children. This spontaneous act by masses of people was called בהלה" — The Rush," by the Jews of Russia. The author shows that this "Rush" of 1835, which is mentioned in the historical literature, had been preceded by similar "Rushes" at various periods in the area of the Polish-Lithuanian state (1764—6; 1775) and in the area of its former boundaries after the partitions of Poland (Galicia — 1773; Southern Prussia — 1793; new Eastern Prussia — 1795; Russia — 1827). Whenever the government imposed restrictions on Jewish marriages or was on the verge of doing so, there was a "Rush". The various "Rushes" and their general and special causes and circumstances are dealt with in the text. Although the different "Rushes" varied in accordance with the time and place, they were all acts of resistance by the Jewish masses against a government which attempted to force on them a cruel change in their way of life and to hurt their social and religious values. The reason for early marriages among the Jews was primarily religious — fulfilment of the commandment to "be fruitful and multiply" and to check sexual behaviour. Boarding with the parents, which in those days solved the economic problems of such marriages, was also an expression of the strong bonds holding the Jewish family together. To governmental circles, forbidding early marriages among the Jews was first and foremost a question of preventing Jewish population increase. They believed that these marriages were responsible for an excessive rate of natural increase among the Jews. In effect, laws made for the special purpose of restricting Jewish marriages were devised at the outset to limit the Jewish population and reduce their numbers even though such laws were influenced by the ideas of Enlightenment that physical, spiritual, and economic maturity was necessary for marriage. Actually, the greatest harm was done to the spirit of the Jewish family, to its religious and moral foundations, its economic development, and the mutual bonds holding its members together. Legal restrictions on Jewish marriages, which are characteristic of "enlightened absolutism", originated in central Europe where they began spreading in the early years of the 18th Century. Here, too, they aroused resentment among the Jews and their leaders persisted in attempts to abolish or mitigate them. Because of this situatoin, there were Jews who avoided settling in those particular countries or felt they had to leave them. Jews who did not emigrate secretly violated the law to the extent that supervision was not excessively strict, either because of the slackness of the administration or as a result of the relative size of the Jewish community. The tendency to restrict marriages reached the Polish-Lithuanian state just before its partition and the restrictions spread during and after the partitions. There, the Jewish community, whose numbers exceeded those of all the communities in central Europe together, reacted to such laws in its own way, by mass action, by a mass rush to marriage. In the second half of the 18th century, the marriage age of Jews in Central Europe rose, either because of government restrictions or as the result of a cultural change among part of the Jewish population. In Eastern Europe, criticism by individual Jews of the old marriage system was not heard until the end of this century, especially from the economic point of view, and even then the voices of the critics were hardly audible. It was only later that the Jewish supporters of Enlightenment adopted new views on marriage and advocated them to the people. Furthermore, they usually justified the special restrictions against the Jews in the name of the ideals of Enlightenment. If the marriage age rose to a certain extent as Enlightenment spread, this achievement could not but be obliterated in the period's general demographic picture resulting from the marriages of minors and children during the Rushes beyond what was customary and acceptable. The phenomenon of the Rushes illuminates the degree of unity and continuity in the society which produced and sustained it. Jewish society in Poland and what had been Poland, divided among itself (Hassidim—Mitnagdim) and partitioned among three kingdoms, appears as a single living organism, every member of which continues reacting reflexively to any attempt to interfere with its traditional way of life and values.},

	abstract = {The Swedish invasion of Poland in the autumn of 1655 met with little resistance and treason was almost universal. Contemporaries, however, accused principally two religious minority groups, the Arians (Unitarians) and the Jews. The Arians against whom charges of heresy were added to the charges of treason, were expelled from Poland in 1660. Investigation of the accusations against the Jews, as service with the enemy forces, espionage, robbing of churches — proves them to be unfounded, as far as the Jewish communi ty in general was concerned. Nevertheless King Jan Kazimierz threatened to expel all the Jews from Poland, and they escaped from this fate only by heavy payment of money. About the year 1660 the Jews spent large amounts of money in order to avert the threatened expulsion; and yet in the reign of Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki (1669-1673), the danger of expulsion still existed, as the result of an accusation, the details of which are unknown. Certain events may have contributed to this threat: on the one hand the expulsion of Jews from Vienna and Lower Austria; on the other hand the movement of Sabbatai-Zevi, and the wars between Poland and Turkey. These reiterated threats of expulsion to which Polish and Lithuanian Jews were exposed in the third quarter of the seventeenth century were due to various and changing causes. The fundamental reason, as in the case of the Arians, was religious fanaticism of the Catholic Church. The political accusation (i.e. charges of treason) which followed occasionally arose to a large extent out of the same fanaticism. The fact that after all, the Jews were not expelled, as the Arians were, may be explained by the essential differences between the two groups. The Arians were few in number, most of them belonging to the lower nobility. Their expulsion was bound to remove a real threat from the dominant church, without causing any harm to the state and its social classes. The Jews, on the other hand, were numerous even after the persecutions of 1648-1656. There was no danger of them propagating their faith like the Arians, their expulsion would cause grave losses to the treasury of the state, to the country's economy, to the King, the Church and the nobility.},

	abstract = {The movement of refugees is a difficult task for research. A typical example of the difficulty is our subject matter: the refugees from Germany had to pass on their way to Poland through towns like Leipzig and Breslau and countries like Moravia, which were forbidden territory to them. Indeed, our information on the eastward movement of refugees from the Thirty Years' War comes almost all from Poland and Lithuania, their palce of destination. The first wave of refugees from Bohemia set out for Poland as early as 1619, and others seem to have followed during the war. The whole of Silesian Jewry, several hundred souls, fled and settled on the Polish border. After the fighting was over, virtually all of them returned to their homes. Only a small part of the Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia took to the road as refugees. Most of these, too, probably returned when the fighting died down, for their countries were near Poland and communications were re-established from time to time. The flight of refugees from Germany seems to have begun in the early thirties of the seventeenth century and continued intermittently for about ten years. They came mainly from places that had been fought over for years, i.e. especially from the lands on the Rhein and on the Main. These unfortunates certainly had no hope and no intention of returning immediately after the fighting had died down — they could not in any case do so because the war still continued in their land. In the nature of things they reached first the western part of Poland-Lithuania, and here — in Great Poland and Lithuania, we pick up their traces. They certanily settled down here, like the non-Jewish refugees. The Jewry of Poland-Lithuania, its organisations as well as individuals, took on the task of charity. Men of substance among the refugees were permitted for the time being to settle in communities and earn a living, often with a rebate on taxes; in the course of time a few at least must have been accepted into the communities. The daughters of the refugees at first earned their living as domestic servants, and were later helped with their dowries out of public funds. Their sons were also sent into domestic service, to learn trades, and especially to study Torah — if found fit for it. The acceptance and education of these refugee children as well as of wandering bakhurim is one of the glories of Polish Jewry. As a group the refugees from Germany did not contribute to Jewish life and treasures in Poland. They scattered and were swallowed up completely into the midst of the numerous Jewish society. Since they settled, as we have said, in the western regions of Poland, they were surely untouched by the war of Chmielnicki. They suffered later, as the war dragged on and spread throughout the state. The bakhurim who came to study in the centres of Torah in Poland and Lithuania and settled there, began to return at that time to their families in the land of their birth. We may assume that some refugees did likewise. Those who had studied at the yeshivoth of Poland and Lithuania must have brought back with them to the Jewish centres of Germany the Torah they had learned in Eastern Europe. Along with the returning German refugees, some Polish-born Jews also turned westward, fleeing from the persecutions to Germany. Having dealt kindly in their time with refugees from Germany, they assumed that they deserved the same kindness and consideration.},

	abstract = {The author endeavours to establish the role of the Jews as one of the causes as well as the victims of the Woszczylo Revolt. The revolt seems to have started in the early forties of the 18th century with a rising of Duke Radzivil's peasants in the district of Krychew, White Russia, under the leadership of Woszczylo. A contemporary Jewish source connects this movement with the names of two Jewish brothers Shmuel and Gedaliah, chief lease-holders and treasurers of Duke Radzivil. The author refers to the Memoirs of Solomon Maimon, to hagiographical stories about the founder of Hassidism and to other Jewish sources. It transpires from these sources that these Jewish brothers who held in lease all of Radzivil's possessions, were promoting lease-holding which had been in Jewish hands. They were extremely rich and used their position to exercies tyrannical authority and power over Jews in and around White Russia. It appears, moreover, that Shmuel and Gedaliah employed high handed methods in dealing with the gentile tenants of Radzivil as well. Respective petitions by the village elders of the Krychew district were addressed to Duke Radzivil complaining of their economic and religious plight. Radzivil's policy of exploitation and suppression was faithfully carried out by his Jewish lease-holders and instigated the peasants to revolt. Other inciting factors were the Greek Orthodox clergy and the Polish gentry. The Greek Orthodox clergy also suffered from social and religious oppression and may have been under the influence of Russia who had religious and territorial interests in Poland. The Polish gentry may have been bribed by Russian money; they hated the house of Radzivil; but above all they resented the powerful Jewish lease holders. The gentry identified, in the eyes of the peasants, Radzivil's administration with his Jewish treasurers, and the treasurers with the Jews, thus averting the revolt from themselves and directing it against the Jewish People as a whole. Woszczylo proclaimed the revolt was exclusively directed against the Jews. However, townspeople, Catholic clergy and Polish gentry were later also attacked. The Woszczylo revolt differed from similar revolts in one point: its only declared aim was war against the Jews. On the other hand powerful Jews such as these two brothers were then non-existent. The author thus arrives at the possibility of an interrelation of cause and effect between the two phenomena.},

	abstract = {The resettlement of Jews in Breslau after their expulsion in 1453 was said to have taken place in 1630 when the Emperor Ferdinand II granted a charter to some Jews permitting them to dwell in the city's suburbs (F. A. Zimmemann) and M. Brann quotes a muncipal decision of 1635 allowing Jews to enter the city from time to time. The author did not find any trace of the charter in the Breslau State and Municipal Archives. On the other hand foreign Jews are mentioned in 1635 when the Municipal Council restricted the number of days on which the Jews might attend the fair and reserved the right to allow the entry of individual Jews into the city in wartime for the benefit of the city. It is obvious that this enabled them to visit the town only for limited periods and by special permit even when there was no fair. The merchants, fearing the competition of the Jews, petitioned against this ordinance but were opposed by the various guilds, who depended on the Jewish buyers and their orders. Actually the resettlement dates from 1656 when Zacharias Lazarus from Náchod (Bohemia) was made official supplier of silver and gold to the Imperial Mint in Breslau in order to overcome the shortage caused by the Thirty Years War. The opposition of the merchants, who had previously prevented the permanent settlement of Jewish suppliers to the mint, was now overcome in consequence of the growing influence of the central authorities. The synagogue which Lazarus established in his house was the first place of worship and existed until 1938. The settlement of the Jews in the suburbs of Breslau dates from 1665—1667. These communities were recognized by the authorities whereas the community of Breslau attained official status only after the Prussian occupation in 1744.},

Rabbi Dosa appended and partly incorporated the work into his novellae on tractate Hullin. These novellae, nowhere mentioned in extant rabbinic literature and completely unknown to modern scholarship, somehow found their way to Yemen, and are quoted in a late Yemenite work on the laws of slaughtering which survived in a very few copies, now found in different libraries.

	abstract = {Our knowledge of the early stages of Jewish settlement in Poland is very meagre and wholly dependent on external sources. The total silence of our literary sources concerning Poland in the 12th—14th centuries created the impression — prevalent from the times of Graetz to this day — that the Jewish communities which were active in Poland at this early period were of a non-intellectual type, maintaining a traditional orthodox way of life, but lacking the typical literary creativity so characteristic of their brethren in central Europe. However, quite a number of medieval rabbinic manuscripts of German (Ashkenazi) origin do provide us with information on, and original rabbinic material by, early Polish scholars. These manuscripts are mainly Halakhic collectanea of sorts and compendia literature on the Pentateuch, genres of little interest to rabbis and scholars alike, and long neglected by both. It now seems that there was quite a number of scholars among the early Jewish settlers, and in fact throughout the 13th century. The present article provides a preliminary list, with a somewhat fuller description of two rabbinic personalities: Rabbi Ya'akov Sevara and Rabbi Moshe Polak. The most important historical conclusion to be inferred from our material — of which there is probably much more still in manuscript — is the Ashkenazi origin of the first Jewish settlers in Poland. A striking fact, threading through our sources, is the intimate connection of all, or most, of these scholars with Chassidei Ashkenaz, the German Pietists, and especially with Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Chassid himself. This fact seems to be proved beyond any reasonable doubt. It would seem that groups of German Jews from among the pietist's circles participated in the large German migration into Poland that went on during the 13th century, taking up the opportunity to establish there new colonies conducted in accordance with their own special religious norms and social standards and under the guidance of their spiritual leader, Rabbi Yehuda Ha-Chassid of Regensburg. This may also provide a sensible answer to the riddle of Rabbi Yehuda's 'exile' — in mid-life — from his native illustrious Speier on the Rhein to the far-off Regensburg. Regensburg might have served him much better as an eastern outpost, facilitating the connections between him and his pupils. The article also outlines the main historical stages of the early Jewish settlement in Poland, and supplies a number of new early dates and facts on different localities in Poland.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to examine the stages in the development of the 'Council of Four Lands' (Vaad Arba Arazot), an institution of vital importance in the shaping and strengthening of Jewish self-government in Poland and Lithuania four hundred years ago. Prolonged attempts at communication between representatives of the major communities (and 'circuits' — gelilim) led to the formation of the Council. It served as a regulatory body among the communities, frequently resolving disputes of a legal or fiscal nature. The Council also instituted regulations aimed at solving extraordinary and complicated problems that transcended the competence or authority of any single community. Upon reaching an advanced stage of organization, with full recognition and cooperation extended by the highest institutions of the land, the Council would also serve as mediator in disputes between the institutions of the Jewish community and those of the government. The accomplishments of the representatives of the Jewish community were achieved thanks to a particular constellation of circumstances. The author examines these conditions in the light of government documents as well as private ones. Particular attention is given to an analysis of the Jewish role in collecting state revenue by means of contracting monopolies on salt mining and distribution, production and merchandising of beverages, the leasing of responsibility for collecting customs duty and the minting of coins. Socially and politically these occupations were extremely sensitive areas during the reign of Stephan Batory, due to the latter's military undertakings against Moscovite Russia.},

	abstract = {This article deals with a wide-spread thesis popular among Polish historians in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (primarily those dealing with the legal history of Poland), which considered the enhanced privilegium that served the Jewish community of Poland for 300 years a forged document. These scholars maintained that the document was devised and forged by the leaders of the Jewish community (seniores Judaeorum) of 'Great Poland' (Polonia Maior), notwithstanding the fact that it served as a basic declaration of rights ratified by almost all the kings of the land and that it was recognized as legally binding since 1453. The proponents of the forgery thesis and those who accepted their contention based their claims upon the flaws that purportedly are included in the preamble to the document, written in the name of King Cazimir III (The Great). The author examines the validity of this argument in the light of diplomatic, heuristic and hermeneutic criteria applied by historians in the examination of the form, contents, nature and implications of medieval documents. The proponents of the forgery thesis (e.g. St. Kutrzeba, R. Hube) also claimed that the rights granted the Jews in the privilegium even exceeded those granted the aristocracy, and this they sight as further evidence of fabrication. However, none of these Polish historians ever examined the original document, which apparently did not survive the upheavals of the fifteenth century, nor did they make a serious effort to study any of the authentic 15th and 16th century copies of the privilegium, extant in the archives of Poznan, Lwow and Lȩczyca, and possibly other cities as well. As part of his examination of the tendentiousness of modern historians, as well as that of compilers of legal codices of Polish law and Polish publicists (from the age of the renaissance and enlightment), the author presents and analyzes the frequent attempts in Polish historiography to belittle and distort the legal and constitutional status of the Jews in Old Poland. The author further more suggests a solution to the problems surrounding the dating and formulation of the enhanced privilegium of Great Poland, which in time proved to be a major legal asset for Polish Jewry.},

	abstract = {The commercial activity of Jews in Poland led to their participation in the development of salt mines and in the commercial exploitation of salt reserves in the later half of the 16th century, despite the government monopoly over the production and distribution of salt. The initiative of Jewish businessmen led as well to the more efficient use of cheap waste material and in improving the process of turning it into a popular product like refined salt. This article deals with the partnership between a noble close to the royal family and a wealthy Jewish businessman from Cracow, who together founded a salt-refining plant in Bendzin, in order to exploit efficiently the surplus waste material being brought from the mines in the District of Cracow and to satisfy the growing demand for salt in Silesia, which was close to the southwest Polish border. The basis for the partnership was the nobleman's ability to provide the requisite amount of raw material for the salt-refining plant in Bendzin and the capital which the Jewish businessman could invest to set up the plant, as well as his readiness to take on the supervision of the plant. The article contains an analysis of the contract drawn up by the partners and its significance. Due to the feudal-hierarchical nature of the production and distribution of salt in the Poland of that time, the right to establish this plant was granted exclusively given to the nobleman Prosper Provana. Therefore, the contract for actually setting up the plant was in the form of a letter from the nobleman to the Jewish businessman from Cracow, in which the former proposed the founding of the plant on terms of parity and equal distribution of the financial and operational burden, with equal share in the profits. The contract dealt with in this article also provides insight into the technology used in the plant and the use of the labor force.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to examine the stages in the development of the 'Council of Four Lands' (Vaad Arba Arazot), an institution of vital importance in the shaping and strengthening of Jewish self-government in Poland and Lithuania four hundred years ago. Prolonged attempts at communication between representatives of the major communities (and 'circuits' — gelilim) led to the formation of the Council. It served as a regulatory body among the communities, frequently resolving disputes of a legal or fiscal nature. The Council also instituted regulations aimed at solving extraordinary and complicated problems that transcended the competence or authority of any single community. Upon reaching an advanced stage of organization, with full recognition and cooperation extended by the highest institutions of the land, the Council would also serve as mediator in disputes between the institutions of the Jewish community and those of the government. The accomplishments of the representatives of the Jewish community were achieved thanks to a particular constellation of circumstances. The author examines these conditions in the light of government documents as well as private ones. Particular attention is given to an analysis of the Jewish role in collecting state revenue by means of contracting monopolies on salt mining and distribution, production and merchandising of beverages, the leasing of responsibility for collecting customs duty and the minting of coins. Socially and politically these occupations were extremely sensitive areas during the reign of Stephan Batory, due to the latter's military undertakings against Moscovite Russia.},

Cetain historians, such as R. Hube, St. Kutrzeba, R. Grodecki, J. Sieradzki, L. Gumplowicz, Ph. Bloch and I. Schipper, were content to establish the year in which the privilegium was issued. Others, such as the author of the Inwentarz Voluminow Legum as well as scholars such as O. Balzer, M. Schorr, M. Balaban and S.A. Bershadsky proposed an incorrect date for the document, having relied on only a portion of the chronological evidence contained in the privilegium. R. Mahler, E. Ringelblum and I. Halpern, who attempted to decipher the correct date by analysing the evidence in acccordance with both the Christian and Roman calendars, also arrived at an incorrect date through a misinterpretation of the allusions to the Roman calendar. In the present brief article the precise date for the privilegium is established as 25 August 1264. The author also supplies methodological notes for a correct reading of the diplomatic and chronological material contained in the document.},

	abstract = {The resettlement of Jews in Breslau after their expulsion in 1453 was said to have taken place in 1630 when the Emperor Ferdinand II granted a charter to some Jews permitting them to dwell in the city's suburbs (F. A. Zimmemann) and M. Brann quotes a muncipal decision of 1635 allowing Jews to enter the city from time to time. The author did not find any trace of the charter in the Breslau State and Municipal Archives. On the other hand foreign Jews are mentioned in 1635 when the Municipal Council restricted the number of days on which the Jews might attend the fair and reserved the right to allow the entry of individual Jews into the city in wartime for the benefit of the city. It is obvious that this enabled them to visit the town only for limited periods and by special permit even when there was no fair. The merchants, fearing the competition of the Jews, petitioned against this ordinance but were opposed by the various guilds, who depended on the Jewish buyers and their orders. Actually the resettlement dates from 1656 when Zacharias Lazarus from Náchod (Bohemia) was made official supplier of silver and gold to the Imperial Mint in Breslau in order to overcome the shortage caused by the Thirty Years War. The opposition of the merchants, who had previously prevented the permanent settlement of Jewish suppliers to the mint, was now overcome in consequence of the growing influence of the central authorities. The synagogue which Lazarus established in his house was the first place of worship and existed until 1938. The settlement of the Jews in the suburbs of Breslau dates from 1665—1667. These communities were recognized by the authorities whereas the community of Breslau attained official status only after the Prussian occupation in 1744.},

	abstract = {The writer examines the Muscovite Kingdom's attitude to the Jews beginning with the sixteenth century. He finds, on the basis of deeds, testimonies and public pronouncements of this kingdom's rulers, that the attitude was extremist and consistent in the hatred of the Jews, in barring them from entering the country and in slaughtering them in those parts of Poland captured by the Muscovites. When Jews reached her borders, they came as converts by coercion or by their own free will. Even during the time of Peter the Great intolerance of the Jew continued, although due to the general development of the State, converts (and possibly also crypto-Jews) began to hold important positions in society (the most significant of which was held by Peter Shafirov who was Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia), and in border areas (Smolensk, Ukraine) Jewish communities were actually established. After Peter's death, expulsion orders multiplied, but these did not succeed in eliminating the Jewish Community until the Expulsion Decree of 1742 which brought about its end. On the other hand, tolerance, when it did appear, was more practical than legal. The extreme and persistent nature of this hatred extended beyond ordinary Xenophobia, and continued into the period when Muscovy turned to foreign aid and invited foreigners to trade within her borders. The writer believes that the roots of this hatred stemmed from an internal struggle that took place in Muscovite Kingdom in the fifteenth century in connection with the "Judaizantes" movement. This movement was not only involved in the ideological and theological criticism of the Russian Church, but raher took part in the political struggle which was being carried on at that time by the ruling circles of the State. This struggle was between the advocates of Byzantine orientation which aimed at an alliance with the Catholic world for the purpose of a Crusade against the Turks and between those proposing a neutral policy in cooperation with the Tartars, Moldavians and the Volochians. The author is of the opinion that the initiators of the movement were Jews and that its leader was one of the chief government officials who was largely responsible for foreign policy, a Fyodor Kuritzin. The opponents of the movement in court circles and in the Church began a campaign of ostracisation against the movement and its Jewish creators, in a battle of ideas, as well as by persecution. Due to Russia's cultural backwardness during the same period where ideological struggles were all but unknown, the opposition to the Jews, fear of them and, as a result of all this, hatred of them, became one of the permanent ideological pillars of both the State and the Church. Such memories as the "Jewish Danger" nourished the Muscovite hatred of the Jews.},

The author studies the legal and social status of Ukrainian Jewry up to the Union between Poland and Lithuania in 1569, (the so-called Union of Lublin). He disagrees with some of the assumptions of the historian S. Bershadski, who wrote the history of Lithuanian Jewry (including Ukrainian Jewry) till 1569. In the period following this Union, and with the annexation of the Ukraine to the Polish kingdom, the large-scale colonization of the Ukrainian steppes began, in which the Jews played a considerable part. This lends a special character to the Ukrainian Jewish community and defines it as a group per se. The author surveys the transition from the Lithuanian to the Polish code of laws, and its effects on the status of Ukrainian Jewry. He studies their legal status in practice, and discusses questions of jurisdiction in the period between the Lublin Union and the Khmelnitzki Massacres of 1648. He concludes that the legal status of the Jews of the western Ukraine approached III that of Poland, while in the eastern Ukraine it was more influenced by existing social conditions and the attitude of the various classes towards the Jews than by legal principles. The author shows that the Jews of the Ukraine kept slaves and sometimes even forced them to observe Jewish customs. With the protection of the nobility the Jews treated court rulings with contempt, going so far as to oppose them; Sometimes even forcing Grand Nobles to observe the Charters which had been granted by the kings to the Jews. The article is concluded with a survey on the relations between the Jews and other classes of society: Nobility, Clergy, and Burghers.},

	abstract = {In the heady days of the 1848 revolution in Galicia an unusual alliance was forged between Polish freedom fighters and liberal Jews, who hitherto had viewed themselves as Germans. Focusing on the struggle for civil emancipation and the recognition of Polish nationalism, the alliance found expression not only in political action, but also in various literary productions, such as pamphlets, poems, and sermons in Yiddish, German, and even in Polish, in praise of freedom and civil liberties. Very little of this literature appeared in Hebrew. On the contrary, Hebrew writers began to react to contemporary events only after the suppression of the 1848 revolution and the establishment of the neo-absolutist government, and then in the form of fulsome praises of the Emperor Franz Josef — the man who had annulled almost all of the revolution's achievements, including Jewish emancipation. Motivated from the outset by different interests, this Polish-Jewish alliance did not last very long, and fell apart after the failure of the revolution. The counter-revolutionary regime in Vienna now treated the liberal Jews with suspicion, and, in the new political climate, encouraged conservative elements, both political and religious. Yet for many Jews, allegiance to the Empire enabled them to avoid the politically painful choice between German and Polish loyalties.},

	abstract = {During the 1680s the Hungarian areas under Ottoman rule were reconquered by the Habsburgs. The newly reoccupied areas were subjected to the Court Chamber (Hofkammer). The border areas were organized as military zones ruled by the army commanders and subordinate to the War Council (Hofkriegsrat). The Hungarian civilian authorities were rather weak and inefficient enabling the many military units in the castles and fortress-towns to assume the positions of power in the newly occupied areas. A common pattern unfolded in these areas: army commanders interested in the services of Jewish army suppliers and money-lenders, and treasury officials interested in the high taxes paid by the Jews, allowed them to settle in areas under their control and offered them protection. Sometimes they even used military force to quell the opposition of the local population, especially the citizens of the royal free cities, who wished to expel the Jews from their territories. Jews had to struggle constantly for their dwelling and trading rights, and they could do so only while being protected and assisted by the authorities. Supported by army commanders and Austrian state officials, Jewish army-suppliers received the protection of the war Council, the Court Chamber, or the Emperor. This protection consisted of a series of privileges, including legal protection, equalization of taxation to the Christians or tax exemption, rights of residence settlement in cities forbidden to Jews, trading rights and freedom of religion. The hostility of the local environment, especially in the royal free cities, made it difficult for the Jews to realize their privileges, and in fact they were able to enjoy them only when enforced by arms. Upon the accession of Maria Theresa to the Habsburg throne (1740) the policy was changed: the military zones' system was reformed and some of the zones were cancelled: cities formerly ruled by the army and the Court Chamber were granted autonomy, and in some cases were allowed to expel their Jewish residents.},

	shorttitle = {The {Hasidic} {Movement} after 1772},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/23561444},
	abstract = {The year 1772 is usually considered a critical juncture or at least a turning point in the history of the Hasidic movement. The events which converged to alter its course were the start of the Opponents' (mitnaggedim) campaign against Hasidism in the spring, the first partition of Poland in the summer, and the death of the Maggid of Mezhirech (miedzyrzec) in December of the same year. This has led the majority of scholars to divide the history of the movement into two clearly distinct stages: (1) From around 1740 to 1772 — an initial period of cohesion during which Hasidism — a regional phenomenon of limited scope — was headed by a single supreme leader, first its founder, the Besht, and later his disciple and heir, the Maggid of Mezhirech. (2) From 1772 on, when, in response to the spread of Hasidism beyond its immediate area of provenance, the political disintegration of Poland which in turn broke up the regional integrity of the movement, the absence of a suitable heir to the Maggid of Mezhirech and the exposure to intense persecution by the Opponents, the movement was de-centralised and began to operate as a network of distinct circles, each led independently by its own supreme leader. In fact, it is argued, de-centralisation did not constitute an abrupt organisational change, nor was it imposed by the events of 1772. From its earliest beginnings, Hasidism operated as loosely affiliated circles of devotees, each clustered around its own charismatic leader. The conventional view of the Besht and the Maggid of Mezhirech as unique central leaders of the Hasidic movement, as a whole, is an anachronistic projection of the cohesive structure of each particular Hasidic 'court' in the post-1772 period on the entire network of Hasidic circles before 1772. The Besht and the Maggid of Mezhirech — clearly distinguished in the collective memory of the movement as the most influential spiritual leaders and teachers of their time — did not exert their influence through any centralised organisational channels: they did not preside over a hierarchy of leaders and did not generate any other mechanism for central control. Even during their lifetime, their associates and disciples, however indebted to them spiritually, functioned as independent, and sometimes rival leaders, each among his own circle of followers. The events of 1772, and the continued expansion of Hasidism, simply exposed and enhanced the pluralistic organisational structure which was inherent in the movement from the start. The most significant organisational change in the post-1772 period is not, therefore, the alleged decentralisation of the movement but the emergence from the early 19th century onward of hereditary succession in the leadership of each particular, centralistic Hasidic 'court'. This was not the mechanism by which succession was regulated in the leadership of early Hasidism. The failure of the Besht's only son to succeed him or, in turn, the failure of the Maggid's son to succeed his father was not, as it is often presented, a breakdown of 'normal' procedures resulting from exceptional circumstances in each case, but rather the inevitable consequence of the absence at that stage of any expectation of formal succession — hereditary or otherwise — within their respective circles of devotees. The Maggid of Mezhirech did not succeed the Besht, nor did the Maggid's disciples succeed him in any formal, institutional sense. The pluralistic organisational structure in which they operated could accommodate the demise of one charismatic leader and the spontaneous emergence of another, or several others, without this being perceived as a direct succession or, conversely, as a crisis of succession in the leadership of the movement as a whole. On the other hand, the distinct organisational and ideological identity of each independent Hasidic circle had not yet become established enough at this stage to generate the expectation of survival beyond the lifetime of each founder by means of an heir. The distinctive identity of each circle and the collectively distinct identity of the movement as a whole were established simultaneously at a later stage. This was initially a response to the outbreak of Opposition in 1772, which for the first time defined coherently the loosely affiliated hasidic circles in reference to the non-Hasidic, now anti-Hasidic camp. The clear differentiation by the Opponents of a collective Hasidic identity triggered off a process of internal Hasidic differentiation of 'paths', each becoming increasingly distinctive, both ideologically and in terms of formal organisation. The dynamics of this process have found their literary expression in various Hasidic adaptations of the Kabbalistic doctrine of the affinity of 'families' of souls, each stemming from a particular divine 'root' or 'spark'. This doctrine was to serve the Hasidic movement from the start as a universal principle by which to explain and legitimate the pluralistic structure of its leadership.},

	abstract = {This essay investigates anew the struggle of Avigdor ben Ḥaim of Pinsk against Ḥasidism, both while he served as Rabbi of Pinsk (1785-1793) and after his dismissal (1793-1796; 1800-1801). The author sees the internal situation in Pinsk and the particular relationship arising out of that situation as determining the character of the struggle. He examines it on the background of the second partition of Poland and the establishment of Russian rule and the juridical status granted by the Russian government to the Jews in these regions (1793-1800). A close review of events in Pinsk shows that R. Avigdor's position in that community under the Polish rule (His appointment, after the dismissal of the Ḥasidic R. Levi Yitsḥak; the tension later between the community and its Rabbi and R. Avigdor's dismissal) as well as the tenor and methods of his struggle against Ḥasidism are closely bound up with the fact that the community owed him a large sum of money, which he gave them on his appointment, as well as with the strong opposition of the Ḥasidic party to his leadership, that gained in strength during his serving in office. Thus R. Avigdor is seen as fighting a combined struggle, in which ideological hatred of Ḥasidism is joined with a tenacious fight for his rights to his position and his money. Analysis of various community and state documents supports this view. The new Russian authorities had no former links neither with R. Avigdor nor with his party in the community. Since 1793 R. Avigdor strives to instruct the new authorities of what he considers the perniciousness of the new 'sect' as well as to prove the personal wrong done to him in Pinsk by the party of that evil sect. What Dubnow saw as an intensification of the old struggle through the use of denunciation,was in reality imposed on both sides of the quarel due to the new legal status of the Jews under the new rulers. Due to this change, the Jews become a part of the general town population (burghers), and therefore subject to the city jurisdiction and state authorities. R. Avigdor brought his case up to the Governor-general of the Minsk area, but failed in his personal struggle. In 1800 a new situation enabled R. Avigdor to renew his struggle. The extreme authocratic reign of tzar Paul I and a new and last attempt of the Lithuanian Mitnaggdim to suppress the Ḥasidic movement, created common ground for Avigdor and the Mitnaggdim party, to denounce the Ḥasidim through a personal complaint. R. Avigdor's new struggle for his position and money was less a departure from ordinary Jewish procedure than his bringing of theological and ritual internal Jewish problems before the Russian state authorities. The author points out that R. Avigdor was tempted to extremism by the general authocratic and meddling ways of Tzar Paul I. Thus he caused the imprisonment and interrogation of the Ḥasidic leader Shneor Zalman of Liadi, who was released shortly afterwards. Avigdor's failure was final and so was the failure of the Mitnaggdim. Thus, a personal tragedy played a major role on the scene of a great ideological conflict.},

	abstract = {The article attempts to reasses the position of the Pinsk community in the struggle of Lithuanian communities against Ḥasidism, and to re-evaluate the common supposition (S. Dubnow, Z. Rabinowicz) which divides the sister communities of Karlin and Pinsk into Ḥasidic and Mitnagged ones. a: A new inspection of the sources on the life of Rabbi Raphael ben Siskind hākohen Hamburger, rabbi of Pinsk in the years 1763-72, reveals that Rabbi Raphael was neutral on the question of Ḥasidism and that he probably evaded being a participant in the Ḥerem against the Ḥasidim. b: A new inspection of the letter of the Maggid of Mezeritz to Rabbi Hayyim and Rabbi Eliezer haLevi, and the evidence on Rabbi Eliezer in Shema Shelomo (author of Siaḥ haSadeh), reveals that Rabbi Eliezer haLevi was not only not an active Mitnagged but that he himself was a Ḥasid or close to Ḥasidism at least till the early eighties and that it is impossible to conclude from the letter that there were real persecutions against the Ḥasidim in Pinsk in 1772 or before that date. c: From the fact that Rabbi Isaac Levi of Berdichev was accepted as rabbi of Pinsk in 1772 or 1776 it follows that Ḥasidism was very influential in the seventies among the leaders of the Kahal and in circles of young scholars. The author believes that the support given by the leaders of the Pinsk Kahal to the Ḥerem of the community of Wilna against the Ḥasidim pronounced at the fair of Zelu in 1781 is couched in moderate language. In Pinsk itself the obvious conclusion — the disavowal of Rabbi Levi Isaac — was not reached. The attitude toward him did not change, and he was not relieved of his rabbinate until the arrival of the firm letter of the Gaon of Wilna in 1784 to the Kahal of Pinsk. He was not removed immediately but allowed to continue in office another year. He could thereby conclude a decennial tenure and then leave for Berdichev. Rabbi Solomon of Karlin was forced to leave Karlin at the same time. The conclusion hereby reached is that till the eighties the community of Pinsk, like its sister community, Karlin, was a center of the Ḥasidic movement. This fact explains why we have no evidence of the community's participation in the Ḥerem of 1772 against the Ḥasidim and how it came about that Rabbi Levi Isaac was appointed rabbi at Pinsk. As to the relationship of the internal forces in the early phases of the movement from the sixties to the eighties, i.e. the spiritual leadership, the power and the influence in both communities was in the hands of the Ḥasidim while the camp of the Mitnaggdim remained neutral toward Ḥasidism. Only under the heavy pressure of the Wilna community and of the Gaon do the Mitnaggdim take up the initiative against Ḥasidism which is temporarily forced into defensive positions. These developments occur in Pinsk as well as in Karlin.},

	abstract = {The struggle against Hassidism flared up anew in 1781, at the instigation of the leaders of the Vilna community. A herem (excommunication) of the Hassidim was proclaimed in Vilna, followed at the beginning of the month of Elul in the same year by a similar proclamation in the town of Zelvah, where the leaders of the chief Lithuanian communities had gathered in conference. These leaders despatched letters from Zelvah to their communities, informing them of the steps taken by Vilna and Zelvah and demanding that they stamp out all trace of Hassidism in their midst and in their surrounding districts by the proclamation of herems and other means. The course of this struggle was described at length by Dubnow in his work "The History of Hassidism". However, Dubnow failed to see that the letter written by the leaders of the Pinsk community was worded differently from those sent by the other communal leaders. In fact the Pinsk leaders made no mention in their letter of the proclamation of a herem because R. Levi Yitshaq (afterwards known as R. Levi Yitshaq of Berdichev) was at that time the rav of Pinsk and the surrounding district and the leaders had no desire to come into conflict with him and his followers. Another letter from Vilna to Pinsk about three years after the herem in Zelvah (which Dubnow published, though he lacked the key to the understanding of its contents), shows that, for about three years, the Vilna leaders continually pressed the Pinsk leaders to take measures against the Hasidim and to expel R. Levi Yitshaq from the town. At first the Pinsk leaders resisted this pressure, since some of them had become either adherents or supporters of Hassidism. But then as a result of some event in the town, the exact nature of which is not known for certain, the Mitnagdim gained the upper hand. Even they, however, refused to obey the orders issued from Vilna and went no further than to impose restrictions on R. Levi Yitshaq's Hassidic activities. The latter apparently disregarded these restrictions and as a result the letter under discussion here, which provides us with information about the developments, was sent from Vilna to Pinsk. In it Vilna orders Pinsk to place the Hassidim under a herem, at long last, and to drive R. Levi Yitshaq out of the town. Nevertheless, R. Levi Yitshaq continued in his office of rav for about a year after the letter was written. This can only mean that the new communal leaders also refused to take drastic measures against him. He left the town in 1785, i.e., after holding the office of rav for ten years. From a comparison with the term of office of his predecessor, and from the fact the his successor was also appointed for a period of ten years, it seems highly probable that R. Levi Yitshaq's appointment as rav was likewise for ten years and that he left the town at the end of his term of office. These developments prove that Hassidism had struck deep roots in Pinsk, a fact that has an important bearing on the third open conflict between the Mitnagdim and Hassidim, which began in 1793 (i.e., in the year of the town's annexation to Russia) with the revolt of the Hassidim in the town and its surrounding district against the authority of the Mitnaged rav, R. Avigdor the son of R. Hayyim. But this conflict is outside the scope of the present discussion.},

In his clash with the rebellious Cossacks under Chmielnicki in 1648, Wiśniowiecki's forces — commanded by the battalion-commander Baranowski — succeeded in wresting control of Nemirov from the Cossacks for one half day. During the battalion's subsequent retreat from Nemirov, the Polish force was joined by Jews who had previously sworn allegiance to the Cossacks, thereby saving themselves from the horrible massacre perpetrated by the Cossacks on the Jews of Nemirov on June 10th 1648. The Hebrew chronicle Zok ha-Ittim, written by R. Meir b. Samuel of Szczebrzeszyn, describes how numerous Jews in Nemirov were forced to embrace Christianity as the only means of saving their lives. From a royal decree ('universal') granted by Jan Kazimir, King of Poland, at the request of the Jews of Pinsk on May 2nd 1650, we learn of Jews there who were forced to convert following the fall of that city to the Cossack rebels on October 26th 1648. It appears that these forced converts were kept in isolation for a year and a half, under the watchful eye of the Russian Orthodox Church, while the city itself had been restored to Polish rule, more sympathetic to the Jews, as early as December 1648. By combining the testimonies of all these sources, it is possible to establish the procedures taken by the Cossacks and Russian Orthodox burghers towards the Jews, who were forced to convert and were thus saved. Conversion, a religious act by definition, was accompanied by an oath of allegiance, a political act. The converts thereby formally joined the burghers of the Ukraine. What ensues from this is that the Jews of Nemirov were given the choice of conversion or death. While, as it seems, the majority chose martyrdom, a certain portion of Jews underwent a forced conversion and swore allegiance to the Cossacks. The converts of Nemirov, as a result of subsequent events, were able to return to Judaism before actually being required to live as Christians.},

	abstract = {The community of Pinsk was profoundly affected by the Khmelnitsky rebellion. The town was occupied by Niebaba's Cossacks on October 26, 1648 with the help of the Russian burghers. On November 9 destroyed Pinsk was retaken by the Poles, who took revenge on its citizens. By the end of 1648, the town was in ruins and abandoned by most of its surviving inhabitants. In subsequent years, the life of Pinsk was gradually restored under conditions of relative tranquillity. The invasion of the Ukraine by Muscovy in 1654 marked the renewal of hostilities between Poland and Muscovy. In the summer of that year, Muscovites and Cossacks occupied regions east of Pinsk. When the danger grew more pronounced in the second half of 1655 the Jews decided to flee. The burghers, however, remained. These decisions had far-reaching consequences. On October 5, 1655, Pinsk was retaken by a small Muscovite-Cossack force, which killed, looted and devastated the town. A plague reduced the population still more. During 1656—1657, both Cossacks and Muscovy wished to take over the Polesie district surrounding Pinsk. Life began to return to normal only at the end of 1657, and in the subsequent two years relative quiet prevailed until in December 1959 a gang of Cossacks commanded by Mikhail Kurhan captured Pinsk and held it for five days. They plundered the town and left it after a ransom of 2,000 zloty was paid by both Jews and burghers. The local nobles formed gangs under the pretext of fighting the Muscovites and also plundered the population. In the summer of 1660, a large Muscovite army attacked Poland. Joining forces, Cossacks, Muscovites and local gangs captured Pinsk again on July 5, occupying it for a fortnight and bringing much suffering to the Jews. From 1661 it was relatively quiet until 1664, when the imminent renewal of warfare brought much suffering to the population, especially in 1665. The result of the continuous struggle was that the burgher population of Pinsk dwindled considerably and became impoverished during the period 1648—1667. On the other hand, the Jews, displaying greater initiative, saved some of their property, on which they were later able to fall back. Before the outbreak of the Cossack revolt in 1648, the Jewish population of Pinsk consisted of about 1,000 persons and was one of the three principal communities of Lithuania, together with Brest and Grodno whose representatives instituted the Lithuanian Council. Most of the Jews managed to flee from Pinsk in the months before the arrival of the Cossacks, having four or five weeks in which to make preparations for their escape. Seventy-eight buildings of the Jews, including the synagogue, were not destroyed, but some of the Jews who stayed behind (a small part of the Jewish population) were killed and others saved their lives only by adopting the Orthodox faith. In December 1648, the Jews of Pinsk began their return home. Normal activities were soon resumed, the community organizations revived, the old leaders still in charge of matters. The Jewish community of Pinsk recovered quickly, as did that of Brest-Litovsk, and took part in the successful effort by the Lithuanian Council to reestablish the life of Lithuanian Jewry. In 1655, before the joint Muscovite-Cossack occupation of Pinsk, the Jews again managed to leave in time and take along at least part of their property. As soon as the invading troops withdrew, they began to return to the town. During the occupation of Mikhail Kurhan in 1659, the Jews of Pinsk did not suffer. However, this was not the case in July 1660, when the Muscovites and Cossacks invaded the town. A number of Jews were tortured, slain or taken prisoner, and there was widespread looting and arson. This period of occupation affected them more profoundly than the invasions of 1648 and 1655, and the community was greatly impoverished. But nevertheless there is a striking difference between the consequences of the various occupations for the Jews and for the burghers. Russian burghers were suspected by the Polish authorities, did not have a worthy leadership and the basis of their existence was seriously damaged. On the other hand, the Jews kept a part of their possessions and could proceed at once to rebuild their homes and restore their sources of livelihood. Moreover, the change of circumstances brought the Jews into new domains of economic activity and their acquisition of houses and land increasingly lent Pinsk the appearance of a Jewish town. Changes also took place in the fate of small communities surrounding Pinsk. Some disappeared as a consequence of the events of 1648 and 1655, while a number of temporary communities became permanently established. Later, both Pinsk and Brest-Litovsk vied with one another for the protection over these communities, where a number of Pinsk Jews were permanently established. Political considerations stemming from the change in the relationship between the nobility and Polish authorities on one hand and the Russian burghers of Pinsk on the other, were a factor contributing to the transfer of the important liquor trade into the hands of Jews. Forced to seek new means of livelihood, many Jews opened small taverns. There were still Jews, even in the sixties, with enough capital to invest in various enterprises, but Jewish commerce had generally suffered. The development of small trade was a characteristic phenomenon of this period. There is reason to assume that the Jews of Pinsk played now a greater role in the crafts. The growing importance of the Jews in the economic life gave rise to the hatred of the burghers, and in the sixties, the religious issue began to assume a prominent place in this animosity. The heads of the Orthodox Church assumed the leadership of the anti-Jewish campaign. The leaders of the community intervened and managed to put a stop to acts against the Jews in 1666.

	abstract = {The community of Pinsk was profoundly affected by the Khmelnitsky rebellion. The town was occupied by Niebaba's Cossacks on October 26, 1648 with the help of the Russian burghers. On November 9 destroyed Pinsk was retaken by the Poles, who took revenge on its citizens. By the end of 1648, the town was in ruins and abandoned by most of its surviving inhabitants. In subsequent years, the life of Pinsk was gradually restored under conditions of relative tranquillity. The invasion of the Ukraine by Muscovy in 1654 marked the renewal of hostilities between Poland and Muscovy. In the summer of that year, Muscovites and Cossacks occupied regions east of Pinsk. When the danger grew more pronounced in the second half of 1655 the Jews decided to flee. The burghers, however, remained. These decisions had far-reaching consequences. On October 5, 1655, Pinsk was retaken by a small Muscovite-Cossack force, which killed, looted and devastated the town. A plague reduced the population still more. During 1656—1657, both Cossacks and Muscovy wished to take over the Polesie district surrounding Pinsk. Life began to return to normal only at the end of 1657, and in the subsequent two years relative quiet prevailed until in December 1959 a gang of Cossacks commanded by Mikhail Kurhan captured Pinsk and held it for five days. They plundered the town and left it after a ransom of 2,000 zloty was paid by both Jews and burghers. The local nobles formed gangs under the pretext of fighting the Muscovites and also plundered the population. In the summer of 1660, a large Muscovite army attacked Poland. Joining forces, Cossacks, Muscovites and local gangs captured Pinsk again on July 5, occupying it for a fortnight and bringing much suffering to the Jews. From 1661 it was relatively quiet until 1664, when the imminent renewal of warfare brought much suffering to the population, especially in 1665. The result of the continuous struggle was that the burgher population of Pinsk dwindled considerably and became impoverished during the period 1648—1667. On the other hand, the Jews, displaying greater initiative, saved some of their property, on which they were later able to fall back.

	volume = {לו},
	issn = {0044-4758},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/23553259},
	abstract = {This essay investigates anew the struggle of Avigdor ben Ḥaim of Pinsk against Ḥasidism, both while he served as Rabbi of Pinsk (1785-1793) and after his dismissal (1793-1796; 1800-1801). The author sees the internal situation in Pinsk and the particular relationship arising out of that situation as determining the character of the struggle. He examines it on the background of the second partition of Poland and the establishment of Russian rule and the juridical status granted by the Russian government to the Jews in these regions (1793-1800). A close review of events in Pinsk shows that R. Avigdor's position in that community under the Polish rule (His appointment, after the dismissal of the Ḥasidic R. Levi Yitsḥak; the tension later between the community and its Rabbi and R. Avigdor's dismissal) as well as the tenor and methods of his struggle against Ḥasidism are closely bound up with the fact that the community owed him a large sum of money, which he gave them on his appointment, as well as with the strong opposition of the Ḥasidic party to his leadership, that gained in strength during his serving in office. Thus R. Avigdor is seen as fighting a combined struggle, in which ideological hatred of Ḥasidism is joined with a tenacious fight for his rights to his position and his money. Analysis of various community and state documents supports this view. The new Russian authorities had no former links neither with R. Avigdor nor with his party in the community. Since 1793 R. Avigdor strives to instruct the new authorities of what he considers the perniciousness of the new 'sect' as well as to prove the personal wrong done to him in Pinsk by the party of that evil sect. What Dubnow saw as an intensification of the old struggle through the use of denunciation,was in reality imposed on both sides of the quarel due to the new legal status of the Jews under the new rulers. Due to this change, the Jews become a part of the general town population (burghers), and therefore subject to the city jurisdiction and state authorities. R. Avigdor brought his case up to the Governor-general of the Minsk area, but failed in his personal struggle. In 1800 a new situation enabled R. Avigdor to renew his struggle. The extreme authocratic reign of tzar Paul I and a new and last attempt of the Lithuanian Mitnaggdim to suppress the Ḥasidic movement, created common ground for Avigdor and the Mitnaggdim party, to denounce the Ḥasidim through a personal complaint. R. Avigdor's new struggle for his position and money was less a departure from ordinary Jewish procedure than his bringing of theological and ritual internal Jewish problems before the Russian state authorities. The author points out that R. Avigdor was tempted to extremism by the general authocratic and meddling ways of Tzar Paul I. Thus he caused the imprisonment and interrogation of the Ḥasidic leader Shneor Zalman of Liadi, who was released shortly afterwards. Avigdor's failure was final and so was the failure of the Mitnaggdim. Thus, a personal tragedy played a major role on the scene of a great ideological conflict.},

	abstract = {Due to its convenient geographic position in the heart of a network of water transport in the Russian Empire, which linked the Black Sea with the Baltic, Pinsk was a central transit point in the export trade of surplus agricultural and timber products of Southwest Russia to Eastern Europe. The prosperity of Pinsk, which began in the middle 1830's, was made possible by incipient changes in economic thought and policy in the Russian Empire and an attempt to set the Russian economy working along capitalist lines. The Jews of Pinsk integrated ably and speedily into the new economic constellation and within ten to fifteen years made their city the commercial capital of the Southwestern region of Russia. Prosperity was evident in the town, there was a living to be made and the great families (epecially the families Lurie and Levin who were related by marriage) gathered much wealth. Despite the vigorous economic prosperity, the population of Pinsk showed a limited growth. When a severe economic crisis overtook the town in the 70's after the building of a railroad network and the diversion of a large part of export goods to rail transport, there were only 20,000 inhabitants. Cities in Lithuania and Belorussia, which at the beginning of the 19th century were of a similar size to Pinsk or even smaller, succeeded in raising their population towards the end of the 19th century (Minsk, Bialystok, Grodna, Brisk) and in the Ukraine towns like Pinsk became cities in the second third of the century. The reasons for this can be found (a) in the way capital was used by the rich of Carlin and Pinsk in semi-"mediaeval" methods, (b) in the dispersal of capital over the wide geographic area of Southwest Russia (the Ukraine), and (c) in the relatively late switch by the owners of capital to industrial enterprise, which during the 60's and 70's remained small. A large part of the capital was removed from Pinsk and furthered the economic progress of the towns of the Ukraine. Capital owners, simple businessmen, agents, clerks and artisans who found a living outside Pinsk did not return and were among the builders of the new commercial and industrial towns of the Ukraine, and, to a lesser extent of other regions in Russia.},

He revives the actual achievements and shortcomings of this movement and comes to the conclusion that the achievements were relatively considerable, although the circumstances of the economy and society and prevalent views concerning Polish-Jewish relations of the period stood in the way of greater success. In 1863, there were 30,000 Jewish farmers in the Kingdom of Poland. Ten of their villages were model communities in the Polish agricultural environment. In the course of the survey, the attitude of the Jewish advocates of Enlightenment and the wealthy Jews on the one hand and of most of the Polish landed gentry on the other to this problem becomes clear. Two personalities are particularly conspicuous for their devotion to and preoccupation with this matter — the Pole Władysław Garbiński and the Jew Mattiasz Rosen. Their standing in this matter and views are clarified in the correspondence between them which is given in the Polish original in Appendix A (1—4), p. 63. In Appendix B (p. 70) the constitution of the Society for the Encouragement of the Jews in the Kingdom of Poland is given. Appendix C (p. 74) contains the circular which the Agricultural Society in the Kingdom of Poland sent to its correspondent members in March, 1861, with regard to the question under discussion. The enthusiastic Polish poem by Alexander Kraushar in praise of Jewish settlement on the land deserves mention; it is published here anew in the original, Note 49, p.},

	abstract = {R. Eliezer b. Joel Ha-Levi (Ravyah; 1140(?)—1225(?) represents a school of thought that wished to enhance the authority of the community both internally and externally. In the first instance, communal authority was stressed vis-a-vis the members of the community, whereas externally Ravyah emphasized the power of the community over that of the rabbis or the courts, whose authority derived from their expertise in halakha rather than from powers delegated to them by the community. An expression of this view may be found in Ravyah's stress that the majority of the community is empowered to make decisions and impose them on the minority, whereas the rabbis or court may not intervene in this process. Accordingly, only the community or its elected and representative body is authorized to pass binding resolutions regarding communal affairs. The 'Good Townsmen' (Tuvei Ha-Ir) comprised such a body. The author examines Ravyah's views in light of the struggle between 'religious' and 'secular' leadership for control of the community. During Ravyah's lifetime the components of communal leadership in Ashkenaz underwent a major change. Whereas up until the middle of the 12th century sages were the dominant factor in the leadership of the community, from that point on a new type of leadership began to assert itself. On a gradual basis, the communities found themselves with leaders whose striking feature was no longer their halakhic erudition, but rather their possession of wealth. Ravyah's objective was to establish a halakhic basis for this new development. The position taken by Ravyah may be seen as a response to the other school of thought on such public issues, whose primary spokesman was Rabbenu Tam (1100? — 1171). The latter strived to limit the impact that the change in leadership would effect over the communities, by rendering the authority of the community subservient to the halakhists. In this light one understands Rabbenu Tam's opposition to the power of the majority in communal affairs, as well as his stipulation that all public decisions be confirmed by the local rabbinic authority (Ḥaver Ir). The takkanot attributed to R. Gershom Me'or Ha-Golah, as well as 'Takkanot Shum' (Speyer, Worms, Mainz) express primarily the attitudes of Ravyah regarding communal leadership.},

	abstract = {The present article announces the discovery of a previously unknown archive of paramount importance for the history of Polish Jewry in the 18th century and presents the preliminary results of its analysis. A central problem in the research of the history of the Jews in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is the absence of comprehensive records. The great majority of the Jewish comprehensive financial records were lost, including the minutes from the Council of the Four Lands. Lists of the Jewish poll tax, the main Polish comprehensive source, were regarded as lost as well. Following earlier research into the causes and results of the transfer of the Jewish poll tax to the benefit of the Polish army, especially following the 1717 reform, it was hypothesized that some lists of the Jewish poll tax might have survived in the archives of the Polish military treasury. A search in the archives of the Polish military treasury fully confirmed this hypothesis. Complete and uninterrupted annual lists of the Jewish poll tax from 1717 to 1764 indeed survived in these archives. It is hard to overestimate the historical value of these lists. The map of Jewish autonomy reconstructed by Halpern can be considerably modified on their basis. Likewise, a map of the Jewish settlement in the whole of the Crown lands of Poland can now be fully reconstructed since all towns and villages inhabited by Jews are listed year after year. Two subjects should be singled out as particularly fruitful fields of research in light of this new and unusually rich information: Jewish economic activity, especially rural leaseholds, and a broad picture of the leadership of the Jewish autonomy and the Jewish communal leadership. The article is supplemented with a general table of the assignment of the Jewish poll tax in the Crown lands of Poland in the 18th century.},

	abstract = {In looking at the influence of religious teachings and mentality on the worshiper's economic activity, we must also consider, especially in the case of Judaism, the resilience of religious laws in the face of economic pressure. The issue is exemplified by three cases: the prohibition on taking interest on loans, the dietary laws and Sabbath observance. The biblical prohibition on a Jew taking interest from another Jew was first expanded by popular understanding to include any profit gained by investment and lending, even if the profit resulted from a change in market conditions. In the course of time, many transactions were defined as resting on rabbinical interpretation only, and as such permitted. Ultimately even straightforward interest on any loan was exempt from the biblical prohibition by means of a legal fiction. This process started during the first generations of the Second Commonwealth, when the livelihood of this puritan society was based on agriculture. The process of circumvention began when trade and credit became a necessity. The prohibition was ultimately dropped in the wake of Jewish involvement in moneylending and capitalistic enterprise. The observance of the dietary laws entailed an economic price, as it obligated those concerned to avoid cheaper types of victuals. Nevertheless, with some marginal exceptions, when religious authorities ruled leniently, to avoid some major loss, the economic factor left the dietary laws unaffected. Similarly, when Sabbath observance prevented Jews from taking advantage of many economic opportunities, the precept was nevertheless consistently maintained. However, allowance was made by permitting Gentiles to engage in work on the Sabbath for the benefit of the Jew — something which had originally been counted as a desecration of the Sabbath. The difference in practice between Sabbath observance and the dietary laws, on the one hand, and the prohibition on taking interest, on the other, is due to the fact that the first two functioned as symbols of religious commitment and communal identification. As long as religious commitment continued, loyalty to the religious law outweighed the economic loss. When rationalistic criticism began to undermine this loyalty, the economic factor could come into play and further undermine religious attachment.},

	abstract = {From the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, the number of charitable, benevolent, and religious confraternities increased in the Jewish communities across Europe, especially in Italy. Numerous studies describe these confraternities. This article uncovers and analyzes the nature of the charitable and benevolent confraternities in the Jewish communities of the Ottoman Empire, especially those in western Anatolia and the Balkans, which have yet to receive scholarly attention. The article presents a detailed account of the image of these confraternities during the early modern period. It traces their organization, their leadership and rank-and-file and inquires into the motivations behind the decisions to join the confraternities. Furthermore, it looks into the ways the confraternities operated as economic agencies, philanthropic entities, and cohesive social groups. Relations between the confraternities and the Jewish community are also examined and the cultural world of the members is described with reference to the influence of the surroundings. The discussion of the confraternities in the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century examines their development and describes their transformation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The confraternities underwent two important and concurrent processes: (1) a transition from a general communal confraternity to one with a defined goal, similar to regional and municipal confraternities; (2) a shift of emphasis from philanthropic activity for the needy to the well-being, spiritual and material benefit of the members themselves. Comparisons are made between the Jewish confraternities in the Ottoman empire and their European counterparts. The correlation between the dissolution of the Sephardi kahals and the emergence of the confraternities corroborates the hypothesis concerning the Sephardi origin of the confraternities. They apparently modeled themselves on several organizational and operational features of the Jewish kahals, but there was also a perceptible impact of the Ottoman guilds. This is clearly manifested in the titles of the confraternities' officers, various administrative terms, and the prevailing atmosphere. In this sense, the confraternity served as a mediator between the Jewish community and its surroundings. The role of the confraternities in this regard sheds further evidence on the relationship between Ottoman Jewry and its surroundings and provides evidence of their immersion in Ottoman culture and society. The appendix elaborates on the various types of Jewish confraternities in the cities of the Ottoman Empire, with extensive references to primary sources and research literature.},

	abstract = {Due to its convenient geographic position in the heart of a network of water transport in the Russian Empire, which linked the Black Sea with the Baltic, Pinsk was a central transit point in the export trade of surplus agricultural and timber products of Southwest Russia to Eastern Europe. The prosperity of Pinsk, which began in the middle 1830's, was made possible by incipient changes in economic thought and policy in the Russian Empire and an attempt to set the Russian economy working along capitalist lines. The Jews of Pinsk integrated ably and speedily into the new economic constellation and within ten to fifteen years made their city the commercial capital of the Southwestern region of Russia. Prosperity was evident in the town, there was a living to be made and the great families (epecially the families Lurie and Levin who were related by marriage) gathered much wealth. Despite the vigorous economic prosperity, the population of Pinsk showed a limited growth. When a severe economic crisis overtook the town in the 70's after the building of a railroad network and the diversion of a large part of export goods to rail transport, there were only 20,000 inhabitants. Cities in Lithuania and Belorussia, which at the beginning of the 19th century were of a similar size to Pinsk or even smaller, succeeded in raising their population towards the end of the 19th century (Minsk, Bialystok, Grodna, Brisk) and in the Ukraine towns like Pinsk became cities in the second third of the century. The reasons for this can be found (a) in the way capital was used by the rich of Carlin and Pinsk in semi-"mediaeval" methods, (b) in the dispersal of capital over the wide geographic area of Southwest Russia (the Ukraine), and (c) in the relatively late switch by the owners of capital to industrial enterprise, which during the 60's and 70's remained small. A large part of the capital was removed from Pinsk and furthered the economic progress of the towns of the Ukraine. Capital owners, simple businessmen, agents, clerks and artisans who found a living outside Pinsk did not return and were among the builders of the new commercial and industrial towns of the Ukraine, and, to a lesser extent of other regions in Russia.},

	abstract = {The article attempts to reasses the position of the Pinsk community in the struggle of Lithuanian communities against Ḥasidism, and to re-evaluate the common supposition (S. Dubnow, Z. Rabinowicz) which divides the sister communities of Karlin and Pinsk into Ḥasidic and Mitnagged ones. a: A new inspection of the sources on the life of Rabbi Raphael ben Siskind hākohen Hamburger, rabbi of Pinsk in the years 1763-72, reveals that Rabbi Raphael was neutral on the question of Ḥasidism and that he probably evaded being a participant in the Ḥerem against the Ḥasidim. b: A new inspection of the letter of the Maggid of Mezeritz to Rabbi Hayyim and Rabbi Eliezer haLevi, and the evidence on Rabbi Eliezer in Shema Shelomo (author of Siaḥ haSadeh), reveals that Rabbi Eliezer haLevi was not only not an active Mitnagged but that he himself was a Ḥasid or close to Ḥasidism at least till the early eighties and that it is impossible to conclude from the letter that there were real persecutions against the Ḥasidim in Pinsk in 1772 or before that date. c: From the fact that Rabbi Isaac Levi of Berdichev was accepted as rabbi of Pinsk in 1772 or 1776 it follows that Ḥasidism was very influential in the seventies among the leaders of the Kahal and in circles of young scholars. The author believes that the support given by the leaders of the Pinsk Kahal to the Ḥerem of the community of Wilna against the Ḥasidim pronounced at the fair of Zelu in 1781 is couched in moderate language. In Pinsk itself the obvious conclusion — the disavowal of Rabbi Levi Isaac — was not reached. The attitude toward him did not change, and he was not relieved of his rabbinate until the arrival of the firm letter of the Gaon of Wilna in 1784 to the Kahal of Pinsk. He was not removed immediately but allowed to continue in office another year. He could thereby conclude a decennial tenure and then leave for Berdichev. Rabbi Solomon of Karlin was forced to leave Karlin at the same time. The conclusion hereby reached is that till the eighties the community of Pinsk, like its sister community, Karlin, was a center of the Ḥasidic movement. This fact explains why we have no evidence of the community's participation in the Ḥerem of 1772 against the Ḥasidim and how it came about that Rabbi Levi Isaac was appointed rabbi at Pinsk. As to the relationship of the internal forces in the early phases of the movement from the sixties to the eighties, i.e. the spiritual leadership, the power and the influence in both communities was in the hands of the Ḥasidim while the camp of the Mitnaggdim remained neutral toward Ḥasidism. Only under the heavy pressure of the Wilna community and of the Gaon do the Mitnaggdim take up the initiative against Ḥasidism which is temporarily forced into defensive positions. These developments occur in Pinsk as well as in Karlin.},

	abstract = {This essay investigates anew the struggle of Avigdor ben Ḥaim of Pinsk against Ḥasidism, both while he served as Rabbi of Pinsk (1785-1793) and after his dismissal (1793-1796; 1800-1801). The author sees the internal situation in Pinsk and the particular relationship arising out of that situation as determining the character of the struggle. He examines it on the background of the second partition of Poland and the establishment of Russian rule and the juridical status granted by the Russian government to the Jews in these regions (1793-1800). A close review of events in Pinsk shows that R. Avigdor's position in that community under the Polish rule (His appointment, after the dismissal of the Ḥasidic R. Levi Yitsḥak; the tension later between the community and its Rabbi and R. Avigdor's dismissal) as well as the tenor and methods of his struggle against Ḥasidism are closely bound up with the fact that the community owed him a large sum of money, which he gave them on his appointment, as well as with the strong opposition of the Ḥasidic party to his leadership, that gained in strength during his serving in office. Thus R. Avigdor is seen as fighting a combined struggle, in which ideological hatred of Ḥasidism is joined with a tenacious fight for his rights to his position and his money. Analysis of various community and state documents supports this view. The new Russian authorities had no former links neither with R. Avigdor nor with his party in the community. Since 1793 R. Avigdor strives to instruct the new authorities of what he considers the perniciousness of the new 'sect' as well as to prove the personal wrong done to him in Pinsk by the party of that evil sect. What Dubnow saw as an intensification of the old struggle through the use of denunciation,was in reality imposed on both sides of the quarel due to the new legal status of the Jews under the new rulers. Due to this change, the Jews become a part of the general town population (burghers), and therefore subject to the city jurisdiction and state authorities. R. Avigdor brought his case up to the Governor-general of the Minsk area, but failed in his personal struggle. In 1800 a new situation enabled R. Avigdor to renew his struggle. The extreme authocratic reign of tzar Paul I and a new and last attempt of the Lithuanian Mitnaggdim to suppress the Ḥasidic movement, created common ground for Avigdor and the Mitnaggdim party, to denounce the Ḥasidim through a personal complaint. R. Avigdor's new struggle for his position and money was less a departure from ordinary Jewish procedure than his bringing of theological and ritual internal Jewish problems before the Russian state authorities. The author points out that R. Avigdor was tempted to extremism by the general authocratic and meddling ways of Tzar Paul I. Thus he caused the imprisonment and interrogation of the Ḥasidic leader Shneor Zalman of Liadi, who was released shortly afterwards. Avigdor's failure was final and so was the failure of the Mitnaggdim. Thus, a personal tragedy played a major role on the scene of a great ideological conflict.},

	abstract = {מאמר זה מציע שלושה נימוקים כלכליים לביטול חוקים הקשורים לאוכלוסיה החרדית בישראל. ראשית, מערכת הסובסידיות הקיימת יצרה עוני רב ותלות בסעד בקהילה החרדית. כשהגברים נשארים בישיבה עד גיל ארבעים בממוצע והאוכלוסיה החרדית מוכפלת מדי 16 שנה, הקהילה תלויה תלות מסוכנת בתשלומי העברה וצדקה. ספק אם העברות אלו יגדלו במהירות שדי בה לכלכל את המשפחות החרדיות ההולכות וגדלות. נימוק שני הוא שכח המונופוליסטי מגביל תחרות בשוק השרותים הדתיים, דבר המביא לאספקת שרותים נחותה בהשוואה למה שניתן לשאר האוכלוסיה. לבסוף, מדינה שמאפשרת תשלומי העברה שמפלים לטובת קהל בוחרים מסוים, מתמרצת התארגנות של מפלגות פוליטיות-דתיות. מפלגות אלו מערערות את יציבות המערכת הפוליטית. למה אבות ואמהות שמשפחותיהם חיות בעוני בוחרים לשלוח את בניהם לישיבה במקום עבודה? מאמר נוסף פיתח מודל כלכלי לפתור חידה זו. בעבודה הזאת אני בוחן את השלכות המודל על המדיניות ומדגיש את העיוותים הנובעים מסבסוד לקהילה הדורשת קורבן אישי כתנאי להשתייכות. הסובסידיה מתבזבזת עקב הגידול בקורבן הנדרש. המאמר מציע מערכת רפורמות שיוויוניות שתרחיב את תוכניות הרווחה הכלכליות ובכך תפצה את הקהילה החרדית על אובדן הסובסידיות והמעמד המונופוליסטי שיש לספקי שירותים עבורה. רפורמות אלו יאפשרו לקהילה החרדית לשגשג בכוחה היא, יתרמו לתפקוד המערכת הפוליטית ויעודדו יחס בריא בין ענפי המסורת היהודית בישראל. This paper offers three economic arguments for ending discriminatory religious law in Israel. First, the current set of subsidies have created massive poverty and welfare dependence in the Israeli Haredi community. With men remaining in Yeshiva till an average age of forty and the Haredi population doubling each 16 years, that community is dangerously dependent on transfers which are unlikely to grow fast enough to support it. Previous work developed a model to explain why fathers with families in poverty choose Yeshiva over work. This paper explores policy implications of that analysis, stressing the extreme distortions that result from subsidizing membership in a community that requires personal sacrifice as an entry requirement. Subsidies are largely dissipated by the induced increase in sacrifice. A second argument for ending discriminatory religious law is that the monopoly status granted to Haredim limits competition in the market for religious services, resulting in underprovision to the remainder of the Jewish population. Finally, the opportunity to draw transfers that discriminate in favor of their own constituencies provides a strong incentive to organize political-religious parties, which have destabilized Israeli politics. The paper offers a set of equitable reforms which would compensate the Haredi community for their loss of subsidies and religious monopoly status by expanding needs-based social welfare programs. By limiting the discriminatory rents that a religious-political can aspire to, such reforms would reduce the incentive of religious groups to organize politically, thus serving as an alternative to (the failed) electoral reform.},

Israeli Ultra-Orthodox men study full-time in yeshiva till the age of 40 on average. Why do fathers with families in poverty choose yeshiva over work? Draft deferments subsidize yeshiva attendance, yet attendance typically continues long after exemption. Fertility rates are high (TFR = 7.6) and rising. A social interaction approach explains these anomalies. Yeshiva attendance signals commitment to the community, which provides mutual insurance to members. Prohibitions effectively tax real wages, inducing high fertility. Historically, the incursion of markets into traditional communities produces Ultra-Orthodoxy. Subsidies and rising alternative wages induce dramatic reductions in labor supply and unparalleled increases in fertility, illustrating extreme responses social groups may have to interventions.},

It has given us a way to think formally about power as the modification of incentives to induce actions in the interests of the principal. Principal-agency theory has evolved significantly as political scientists have sought to make it more applicable to peculiarly political institutions. In congressional oversight of the bureaucracy, increasing emphasis has been placed on negotiation of administrative procedures, rather than the imposition of outcome-based incentives, as originally conceived. Awareness of the problem of credible commitment has impelled more dramatic reformulations, in which agents perform their function only when their interests conflict with those of the principal, and they are guaranteed some degree of autonomy.

The model incorporates non-participation and non-linear taxation. It is applied to Belgian micro-data and is used to evaluate two revenue-neutral versions of the 2001 Tax Reform Act. We find small positive behavioural responses to the reforms. The reforms are not unambiguously welfare-improving. Generally, the first revenue-neutral reform (the actual reform and a household lump-sum tax) is more beneficial to females in couples than the second (the actual reform and a proportional decrease of household disposable incomes).},

I cut a swathe through the social fabric where agency relationships are especially prevalent and examine some of the institutions, roles, forms of social organization, deviance, and strategies of social control that deliver agency and respond to its vulnerabilities, and I consider their impact.

We use the decomposition to (1) provide examples of closed form solutions of the optimal contract, and (2) analyze the existence of optimal contracts. We also show that the first-order approach is valid in generalized agency problems if the production technology satisfies the linear distribution function condition (LDFC) in actions and types. For more general production technologies the Mirrlees-Rogerson sufficient conditions need to be extended to include restrictions on the form of the optimal contract.},

This paper presents a formal analysis of strategies that can be used to deter overly passive and overly aggressive executives and a discussion of their side effects. The typically large amount of uncertainty means that the constituency must base its decision to retain an executive on the outcome of a conflict and not on its apparent ex ante advisability. This uncertainty imposes a cost on the constituency, who may remove an effective, "innocent" executive unnecessarily, and it also imposes a cost on the well-meaning executive, who may be removed from office after making the best possible decision in a difficult case. The mechanism necessary to deter executive adventurism also causes the paradoxical "gambling for resurrection" effect, in which an unsuccessful war that a well-informed principal would terminate is continued because cessation would, given the current state of the world, cause the agent to be removed from office.},

The free-rider problem implies a new role for the principal: administering incentive schemes that do not balance the budget. This new role is essential for controlling incentives and suggests that firms in which ownership and labor are partly separated will have an advantage over partnerships in which output is distributed among agents. A new characterization of informative (hence valuable) monitoring is derived and applied to analyze the value of relative performance evaluation. It is shown that competition among agents (due to relative evaluations) has merit solely as a device to extract information optimally. Competition per se is worthless. The role of aggregate measures in relative performance evaluation is also explored, and the implications for investment rules are discussed.},

As well as factors related to the informational infrastructure, we emphasize that societies accumulate information by repeating certain tasks. Poor societies may therefore have less information partly because the scarcity of capital restricts the repetition of various activities. Two implications of our model are (1) as an economy develops and generates more information, it achieves better risk sharing at a given level of effort, but because agents are exerting more effort and the types of activities are changing, the overall level of risk sharing may decline; (2) with development, the share of ﬁnancial intermediation carried out through market institutions should increase.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a simple model of economic and political institutions that lead to poor aggregate economic performance. In the model economy, groups with political power, the elite, choose policies to increase their income and to directly or indirectly transfer resources from the rest of society to themselves. The resulting equilibrium is generally inefficient because of three distinct mechanisms: (1) revenue extraction, (2) factor price manipulation and (3) political consolidation. In particular, the elite may pursue inefficient policies to extract revenue from other groups. They may do so to reduce the demand for factors coming from other groups in the economy, thus indirectly benefiting from changes in factor prices. Finally, they may try to impoverish other groups competing for political power. The elite’s preferences over inefficient policies translate into inefficient economic institutions. The notable exception to this general picture emerges when long-term investments are important, thus creating a commitment (holdup) problem, whereby equilibrium taxes and regulations are worse than the elite would like them to be from an ex ante point of view. In this case, economic institutions that provide additional security of property rights to other groups can be useful.},

	abstract = {In this article, we revisit the relationship among institutions, human capital, and development. We argue that empirical models that treat institutions and human capital as exogenous are misspecified, both because of the usual omitted variable bias problems and because of differential measurement error in these variables, and that this misspecification is at the root of the very large returns of human capital, about four to five times greater than that implied by micro (Mincerian) estimates, found in the previous literature. Using cross-country and cross-regional regressions, we show that when we focus on historically determined differences in human capital and control for the effect of institutions, the impact of institutions on long-run development is robust, whereas the estimates of the effect of human capital are much diminished and become consistent with micro estimates. Using historical and cross-country regression evidence, we also show that there is no support for the view that differences in the human capital endowments of early European colonists have been a major factor in the subsequent institutional development of former colonies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We propose a simple model of the emergence of equality before the law. A society can support effort (‘cooperation’, ‘prosocial behaviour’) using the carrot of future cooperation or the stick of coercive punishment. Community enforcement relies only on the carrot and involves low coercion, low inequality and low effort. A society in which elites control the means of violence supplements the carrot with the stick, and involves high coercion, high inequality and high effort. In this regime, elites are privileged by both laws and norms: because they are not subject to the same punishments as non-elites, norms are also more favourable for them. Nevertheless, it may be optimal—even from the elites’ perspective—to establish equality before the law, where all agents are subject to the same coercive punishments and norms are more equal. The key mechanism is that equality before the law increases elites’ effort, which improves the carrot of future cooperation and thus encourages even higher effort from non-elites. Equality before the law combines high coercion and low inequality. Factors that make equality before the law more likely to emerge include limits on the extent of coercion, greater marginal returns to effort, increases in the size of the elite group, greater political power for non-elites and, under some additional conditions, lower economic inequality.},

The Ashkenazi Jews who settled in the Polish Crown, and then developed the largest Jewish diaspora at the time, also created a unique structure of regional government. Unfortunately, despite the fascination of many researchers with the phenomenon of the Council of the Four Lands or the Jewish self-government, the progress of research on these institutions has been hindered due to the destruction of many sources – partly during the period of partitions, partly as a result of losses suffered during World War II, especially during the Warsaw Uprising. Original registers of Jewish Councils (territorial communities) and Vaads (congresses of community representatives) did not survive (in contrast to the Lithuanian Vaad) and neither did those of the institutions of the Polish-Lithuanian state – the Crown Treasury, the Crown Tribunals (especially the Treasury Tribunal), the Assessorial Court, and many key castle courts (sądy grodzkie). Other documents are scattered in archives of varying provenance and difficult to access (mainly due to their dispersion and state of preservation). Most of them survived in the files of non-Jewish courts, especially castle courts, which were treated as public records.},

מס הגולגולת הקולקטיבי היה למעשה מעין צורה של “חכירת מס” שהייתה נהוגה במדינות הקדם מודרנית, השלטונות החכירו פונקציות שונות בהליך גביית המס לגובי מיסים בתמורה לשכר; שיעור בהכנסות.
גביית מיסים אפקטיבית דורשת שמספר תהליכים יתבצעו באופן יעיל: ראשית, יש לזהות את העסקה הניתנת למיסוי, שנית, יש להעריך את הרווחים הנובעים מהעסקה, שלשית, יש לאסוף את המס מהפרטים.
נדרשת מערכת אכיפה במקרה של סירוב תשלום, מערכת לערעורים במקרה של הערכת יתר, ומערכת פיקוח על שחיתות פנימית.
מיצוי פוטנציאל ההכנסה ממיסים דורש שלאליטה הממסה יהיה מספיק ידע, אודות ההכנסה הניתנת למיסוי, ידע שמטבעו הוא א-סימטרי. עסקאות, בעיקר אלו הניתנות לסיכון ונושאות ריבית, קשות להערגה, במיוחד בהנתן עלויות גבוהות להעברת אינפורמציה.
מסיבה זו, מדינות קדם מודרניות רבות, דוגמת, הרפובליקה הרומית, האימפריה הרומית,, צרפת ואחרות, אימצו שיטה של החכרת זכות גביית המס. בשיטה הזו השלטון מציע את זכות גביית המס למכרז, והזוכה במכרז מתחייב למסות את האוכלוסיה המקומית תמורת פרמיה מסויימת, שכר, או חלק מההכנסות.
מדוע שהשלטון יבחר להחכיר את המס?
בהעדר מנגנון ענישה על אי גביית המס, פעילות של גביית מיסים יוצרת בהכרח בעיית סוכן מנהל, שבה האסטרטגיה “לקחת שוחד” היא אסטרטגיה שולטת חזק עבור הסוכן.
נניח שהסוכן גובה מהאוכלוסיה T, בתמורה ל{\textbackslash}alpha T מהמס. כאשר alpha{\textgreater}0{\textgreater}1
במקרה כזה, האוכלוסיה הממוסה תציע לסוכן alpha +{\textbackslash}delta T, ובהעדר קנס. הסוכן יסכים לכך. כדי שלסוכן לא יהיה תמריץ לרמות, השלטון צריך להעלות את השכר שלו ל{\textbackslash}alpha + delta. עד לרמה שבה הפרמיה של הסוכן גבוה מהפרמיה של הגוף הממסה. במצב כזה, עדיף לכתר “לחתוך את המתווך”, ולקבל את הפרמיה של הסוכן.
תחת מנגנון ענישה, הפרמיה של הסוכן צריכה להיות גבוהה יותר מהעונש שיוטל עליו אם יקח שוחד תחת ההסתברות שיתגלה. אם נניח אסימטריה מושלמת של מידע, כלומר המנהל לא יודע שום דבר על הרווחים, אז ההסתברות לגילוי היא 0, ככל שהעונש חזק יותר וההסתברות גדולה יותר, כך תשלום השוחד יהיה גבוה יותר.
משחק אסטרטגי:

חולשת השלטון הפולני לא רק מבחינת ידע מוגבל לגבי הכנסות אלא גם מבחינת יכולת האכיפה שלו, הופכת את מערכת ההחכרה לרווחית יותר. אבל, הנסיון לגבות באמצעות גובי מיסים חיצוניים שמונו בידי השלטון לא הצליח, לאחר מספר נסיונות, השלטונות בחרו להטיל מס גולגולת קולקטיבי על כל אוכלוסיית יהודי פולין ליטא, ולהטיל את חובת גביית המס על גוף פנימי המורכב מאליטה רבנית וכלכלית, גוף שיכל לחלק את המיסים בין הקהילות, להטיל סנקציות במקרה של אי ציות ולשמש כערכאה משפטית.
על אף שהיקף הסמכויות של הגוף מעולם לא צוין במפורש, הוא הפך דה פקטו לגוף מחוקק עם אוטונמיה מנהלית.
העיקרון שעל בסיסו פעלה מערכת הגביה היא מערכת המחייבת
גביית מס קבוע בתמורה לפרמיה

“In principle, taxes can be collected with three quite different forms of contract between the tax collecting authority and the tax collector: wage, share and fixed rent contracts. Wage contracts occur when the government hires on fixed wages tax collection agents who agree to turn over to the government all the taxes they collect; share contracts occur when in lieu of a wage payment the agent holds onto a prespecified share of the taxes collected; fixed rent contracts are those in which the tax collector (farmer) agrees to pay a prespecified fixed sum to the government in return for the right to the entire tax proceeds. Moreover, since tax collection activities involve a number of distinguishable functions, such as the identification (of the taxable transaction), assessment, collection, enforcement and appeal, each one of which could be contracted for in a different way, mixtures of contracts are also possible. At present, however, wage contracts are so domin” (Azabou and Nugent, 1988, p. 684)

Research on this question has been distinguished by its rarity and obscurity, but the few estimates we have should make economists' jaws hit their desks. The gains to eliminating migration barriers amount to large fractions of world GDP—one or two orders of magnitude larger than the gains from dropping all remaining restrictions on international flows of goods and capital.

This indicates that early parliamentary regimes required legal capacity to harmonize domestic institutions and reduce the transaction costs. The Polish case suggests a hypothesis that the pre-1800 “Little Divergence” between European parliamentary regimes could be explained by differences in their governments’ capacities.},

	abstract = {The author endeavors to show that the colonization of Eastern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries was but one link in the chain of European Jewish colonizations throughout the Middle Ages and the beginning of the modern period. As sources, he used land survey records, various documents, and general and Jewish halachic and homiletic literature. The article begins with a discussion of the political circumstances and the demands of security which made this colonization possible as well as those forces which moved the Jews to take part in this movement. The author describes, on the basis of his documentary evidence and a comparison of the statistics derived from it, the ebbs and flows of this colonization during different periods and in different areas. The appended map shows the spread of Jewish settlement throughout this area between 1503 — the year the Jews returned after their expulsion from Lithuania — and 1648 — the year of the Khmelnitski Revolt. It also shows that the most intensive colonization occurred after 1569 — the year of the Lublin Union of Poland and Lithuania. In the eastern Ukraine, the tempo of settlement rose only with the beginning of the 17th century. The author goes on to describe the specific livelihoods of the Jewish settlers and their maintenance and commercial exploitation of the estates of the Polish nobility. He examines the types of pledges and leases (Arenda) whereby the Jews held these lands. He contraverts the opinion of the Russian historian, Vladimirski-Budanov, that the Jews abandoned these types of holdings because trade and usury were more profitable. The article continues with a description of the social and economic conditions of the establishment of the Arenda as the dominant form of land tenure. The author shows that there is a continuity from the previous form of rent tenure to the Arenda. We learn that these are the root and foundation of the Eastern European Jew's existence as lease-holder and innkeeper in the villages and towns up to the 19th century.},

	abstract = {In his fifth chapter the author deals with processes of disruption within kehilloth and the restriction of the social basis of the kahal, which so weakened Jewish self-government in Poland and enabled takkifim to seize power. Two internal streams of migration led to changes in the character and structure of the Kehillah; one stream filled the towns and larger villages with refugees from the Podole and Volhynia districts where nine-tenths of the Jewish population was destroyed; and afterwards a second stream brought well-to-do elements with economic enterprise and commercial experience and ressources from the towns to the larger villages, where they were given the possibility of participating appreciably in the revival of agricultural life in the same regions as had been devastated by war. These elements left the towns on account of the anti-Jewish attacks of the townsfolk and the economic decline of the towns in Poland. These two streams of migration were actually outside the authority of the kehillah, and their existence and living depended not on right but on sufferance. The people living outside the towns were directly dependent upon the squirearchy and gentry and landowners, and did not wish to recognise the juridical institutions established by the kehilloth for the imposition of its economic authority on the Jewish population (Hazakah and haaracha). The social basis of the kehillah was therefore restricted at either end, by both the wealthy village-dwellers and the poor townsfolk. In Chapter 6 the author describes the increasing social differentiation in the communities and the resultant moral decline. The author brings evidence regarding the great and numerous differences in the standards of living of the various sections of the Jewish population, and the difference between the chief lessees and their assistants in the villages. The lowest level of all was that of the "professional poor" and unemployed, part of whom were constantly on the move. Next came those engaged in service, amounting to about 8\%, who were also regarded as a very low class. The relatively "established" section of the Jewish masses was that of the artizans, who apparently constituted more than a quarter of the Jewish population. The "intellectual proletariat" of the kehilloth seems to have been particularly important. The most important offices were in the hands of the leading families, while the position of scholars, dayanim, preachers, teachers and the like was one of semi-starvation. The accentuation of the social difference also helped to produce a decline in social morality throughout the community. This found expression not only in the attitude of contempt and mutual disregard between the various groups, but also in the increased contact between the well-to-do classes and the Polish squirearchy, in adaptation to their manner of life, and the increasing number of poor who permitted themselves to break the law; while the number of converts at both ends of the social scale was by no means small. At the same time, however, active opposition was also aroused by these disruptive tendencies, and the masses and residents of villages began to establish an opposition in the kehilloth, headed by the circles of the intellectual proletariat. A study of the manner in which this opposition functioned can, in the author's opinion, provide much information about the social foundations of Hassidism.},

It argues that cooperation, contrary to conventional wisdom, is neither a goal in itself, nor is it a good enough proxy for the collective good. Cooperation should be supported only when it genuinely promotes the interest of the community as a whole, which is not necessarily the case in the four initiatives examined. As for transaction costs and market failures, although their elimination indisputably seems to be a community interest that should be pursued, correcting only some of them may raise a second best problem.},

Another aspect that can be assumed when combining taxation documents and the sources of the first Jewish census of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1764–5 and when making some rough estimates is the approximate number of Karaites before the census was completed, challenging the dominant stance in the historiography, which estimates the size of the Karaite community to 2 per cent of the entire Jewish population. This brief comparison of the tax burden of the Karaite and Rabbanite communities provides new research perspectives that can lead us to an explanation for the rapid growth in the taxation of the Jews after the census in 1765 and the establishment of new fiscal regulations by the state.},

            Economists increasingly highlight the role that human capital formation, institutions and cultural transmission may play in shaping health, knowledge and wealth. We study one of the most remarkable instances in which religious norms and childcare practices had a major impact: the history of the Jews in central and eastern Europe from 1500 to 1930. We show that while birth rates were about the same, infant and child mortality among Jews was much lower and accounted for the main difference in Jewish versus non-Jewish natural population growth. Jewish families routinely adopted childcare practices that recent medical research has shown as enhancing children's well-being.},

	abstract = {This overview deals with the development of population statistics in Germany and Prussia, where different streams and trends in the field of statistics can be observed until the end of the 18th century: (1) the so-called university statistics (Staatenkunde); (2) political arithmetic; (3) table statistics; (4) “German Kameralia;” and (5) Prussian financial science. The most important sources for historical demographic research are the parish registers. In Germany, they start in the early or high Middle Ages as baptismal lists. In Prussia in the 16th century, parish registers consisted of entries and items of baptisms (births), marriages, and funerals (deaths). Based upon these parish registers at the end of 17th century in the Brandenburg Electorate, population lists were set up as registers or tables of population movement, as “general registers of the born, the married, the deceased, and the communicants.” Physicians and such Prussian medical authorities as the Collegium medicum and the Collegium sanitatis collected data about the causes of death and the longevity of human life (people more than 90 years old). In the course of 120 years during the 17th and 18th centuries, about 350,000 immigrants came to Brandenburg-Prussia. The Prussians developed excellent migration and census statistics in the form of historical tables. From the founding of the Prussian Office of Statistics in 1805 until its reorganization in 1809–1810, historical tables were set up using population statistics.},

	abstract = {In {\textless}em{\textgreater}Order without Law{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, Robert Ellickson shows that law is far less important than is generally thought. He demonstrates that people largely govern themselves by means of informal rules-social norms-that develop without the aid of a state or other central coordinator. Integrating the latest scholarship in law, economics, sociology, game theory, and anthropology, Ellickson investigates the uncharted world within which order is successfully achieved without law. The springboard for Ellickson's theory of norms is his close investigation of a variety of disputes arising from the damage created by escaped cattle in Shasta County, California. In "The Problem of Social Cost"-the most frequently cited article on law-economist Ronald H. Coase depicts farmers and ranchers as bargaining in the shadow of the law while resolving cattle-trespass disputes. Ellickson's field study of this problem refutes many of the behavioral assumptions that underlie Coase's vision, and will add realism to future efforts to apply economic analysis to law. Drawing examples from a wide variety of social contexts, including whaling grounds, photocopying centers, and landlord-tenant relations, Ellickson explores the interaction between informal and legal rules and the usual domains in which these competing systems are employed.{\textless}em{\textgreater}Order without Law{\textless}/em{\textgreater} firmly grounds its analysis in real-world events, while building a broad theory of how people cooperate to mutual advantage.},

	isbn = {978-90-04-50161-4},
	abstract = {This source-reader invites you to encounter the world of one thousand years of Jewish self-government in eastern Europe. It tells about the beginnings in the Middle Ages, delves into the unfolding of communal hierarchies and supra-communal representation in the early modern period, and reflects on the impact of the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and of growing state interference, as well as on the communist and post-communist periods. Translated into English from Hebrew, Latin, Yiddish, Polish, Russian, German, and other languages, in most cases for the first time, the sources illustrate communal life, the interdependence of civil and religious leadership, the impact of state legislation, Jewish-non-Jewish encounters, reform projects and political movements, but also Jewish resilience during the Holocaust. "The reviewed volume is a valuable publication reflecting the considerable work of the editors, authors and translators. It allows English-speaking readers to reach out to materials previously inaccessible linguistically. Most importantly, it allows to include and/or introduce the history of Polish Jews into the didactics of universitites worldwide." Anna Michałowska-Mycielska, Studia Judaica (quote was translated from Polish)  "The collection of sources provides expert introductions to the individual period-chapters which consider both Jewish and non-Jewish material. Throughout, the volume successfully illustrates the complex realities of Jewish self-governance in the Polish and Lithuanian lands. It represents an important contribution, especially for the academic classroom. Beyond the breadth of evidence and the concise discussion of the various periods, the volume fulfils its promise of providing an ‘entangled history.'"

	abstract = {The fall of the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania and the partition of the state weakened the institutions which had kept the Polish Jews communally united. These had existed until the end of the eighteenth century despite the abolition of the Council of the Four Lands in 1764. New integrating factors emerged because of the changes in state dependence and the legal and economic position of the Jews, their relations with the Polish population and the administrations of the partitioning powers, as well as the emancipation processes and acquisition of real and formal equality, assumed different forms in the three areas of partitioned Poland. Of great relevance, as well, were the internal factors -Jewish attitudes toward inherited forms of communal organization and the distinctive features of this religious and cultural life. In the nineteenth century, processes developed which were already evident among the Polish Jews in the pre-partition period. Economic, social and cultural stratification accentuated. But it is chiefly religious divisions which are important to us here, since they affected how and why synagogues were built.In the first half of the nineteenth century, mitnagdim, the followers of classical rabbinical Judaism, were largely recruited as members of the superintendence of synagogues. (This institution was introduced in the 1820s in the Congress Kingdom of Poland and Galicia, to replace the kehillah organization.) It was mitnagdim who were typically put in charge of communal property, which included synagogues, batei mdrash (study houses), ritual baths and the like, and who made decisions concerning their management.Hasidism grew in opposition to rabbinical Judaism. Originating in the eighteenth century in Podolia, during the nineteenth century it spread across Galicia, the Congress Kingdom of Poland and the Russian partition zone, becoming increasingly dynamic and popular among the Jewish masses. The religious life of the Hasidic Jews was centred around the homes of their spiritual leaders or tsaddiks. The hasidim did not normally take part in religious services held in the synagogue, and they prayed in their usually small shtibels, frequently located in private houses. Occasionally a few shtibels were situated in the same town, each one attracting the followers of a different tsaddik. Hasidim also erected their own large synagogues (for instance, Glancer's synagogue in Lw6w, the synagogues at Kowno, Sadagóra).},

Therefore, they can serve as an excellent complement to other sources in the field, including Jewish ones, and those of various secular institutions and offices. It should be noted, however, that the credibility of the information contained in monastery chronicles is always dependent on the distance in time and space between the chronicler and the described events and should—if possible—be verified against other documentary sources from the same period.},

As a result of this association, the Polish tax system was introduced into Lithuania with only relatively minor changes. The revenues and expenditures of the two parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita or Res Publica) were kept separate, but both states frequently financed the same political ventures. This chapter presents the results of research based on a comparison between the fiscal systems of the kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and demonstrates the revenue balance between the two states in times of war. In particular, it draws upon materials found in Russian archives: among their holdings are documents from the Lithuanian Chancellery known as Metryka Litewska, which include data on the income and expenditure of the Lithuanian treasury. In general, however, the sources for Polish fiscal history are much more extensive than for those of Lithuania and for this reason the emphasis of the chapter is on Polish developments.},
